-1 at once overly old-fashioned in its sudsy plotting and heavy-handed in its effort to modernize it with encomia to diversity and tolerance . 
-1 it becomes gimmicky instead of compelling . " interview " loses its overall sense of mystery and becomes a tv episode rather than a documentary that you actually buy into . 
-1 though tom shadyac's film kicks off spookily enough , around the halfway mark it takes an abrupt turn into glucose sentimentality and laughable contrivance . 
-1 i was trying to decide what annoyed me most about god is great . . . i'm not , and then i realized that i just didn't care . 
+1 diane lane works nothing short of a minor miracle in unfaithful . 
-1 a picture as erratic as its central character . 
+1 the sheer joy and pride they took in their work -- and in each other -- shines through every frame . 
+1 by no means a great movie , but it is a refreshingly forthright one . 
-1 schnitzler's film has a great hook , some clever bits and well-drawn , if standard issue , characters , but is still only partly satisfying . 
-1 while the ensemble player who gained notice in guy ritchie's lock , stock and two smoking barrels and snatch has the bod , he's unlikely to become a household name on the basis of his first starring vehicle . 
-1 [a] boldly stroked , luridly coloured , uni-dimensional nonsense machine that strokes the eyeballs while it evaporates like so much crypt mist in the brain . 
-1 fluffy neo-noir hiding behind cutesy film references . 
+1 road to perdition does display greatness , and it's worth seeing . but it also comes with the laziness and arrogance of a thing that already knows it's won . 
-1 human nature is a goofball movie , in the way that malkovich was , but it tries too hard . 
+1 it's nice to see piscopo again after all these years , and chaykin and headly are priceless . 
+1 among the many pleasures are the lively intelligence of the artists and their perceptiveness about their own situations . 
-1 this rather superficial arthouse middle-brow film knows how to please a crowd , and that's about all it does well . 
-1 so bland and utterly forgettable that it might as well have been titled generic jennifer lopez romantic comedy . 
+1 i don't think most of the people who loved the 1989 paradiso will prefer this new version . but i do . 
+1 less cinematically powerful than quietly and deeply moving , which is powerful in itself . 
-1 this is more a case of 'sacre bleu ! ' than 'magnifique' . 
-1 'ejemplo de una cinta en que no importa el talento de su reparto o lo interesante que pudo haber resultado su premisa , pues el resultado es francamente aburrido y , por momentos , deplorable . '
-1 plays like an unbalanced mixture of graphic combat footage and almost saccharine domestic interludes that are pure hollywood . 
-1 a little more intensity and a little less charm would have saved this film a world of hurt . 
-1 the movie turns out to be [assayas'] homage to the gallic 'tradition of quality , ' in all its fusty squareness . 
-1 horrendously amateurish filmmaking that is plainly dull and visually ugly when it isn't incomprehensible . 
-1 both stars manage to be funny , but , like the recent i spy , the star chemistry begs the question of whether random gags add up to a movie . 
+1  . . . a quietly introspective portrait of the self-esteem of employment and the shame of losing a job . . . 
-1 family togetherness takes a back seat to inter-family rivalry and workplace ambition&#133 ; whole subplots have no explanation or even plot relevance . 
-1 snipes relies too much on a scorchingly plotted dramatic scenario for its own good . 
-1 serving sara doesn't serve up a whole lot of laughs . 
+1 a poignant comedy that offers food for thought . 
-1 its salient points are simultaneously buried , drowned and smothered in the excesses of writer-director roger avary . 
+1 irwin is so earnest that it's hard to resist his pleas to spare wildlife and respect their environs . there are far worse messages to teach a young audience , which will probably be perfectly happy with the sloppy slapstick comedy . 
-1 for the most part , i spy was an amusing lark that will probably rank as one of murphy's better performances in one of his lesser-praised movies . 
-1 it's as if solondz had two ideas for two movies , couldn't really figure out how to flesh either out , so he just slopped em together here . 
-1 [creates] the worst kind of mythologizing , the kind that sacrifices real heroism and abject suffering for melodrama . 
+1 crush is so warm and fuzzy you might be able to forgive its mean-spirited second half . 
-1 brainy , artistic and muted , almost to the point of suffocation . 
-1 long time dead ? not nearly long enough . 
-1 the film makes strong arguments regarding the social status of america's indigenous people , but really only exists to try to eke out an emotional tug of the heart , one which it fails to get . 
-1 not once does it come close to being exciting . 
-1 in the end , ted bundy's only justification is the director's common but unexplored fascination with the frustrated maniac ; there's no larger point , and little social context . 
+1 it's a hoot and a half , and a great way for the american people to see what a candidate is like when he's not giving the same 15-cent stump speech . 
+1 a movie that will wear you out and make you misty even when you don't want to be . 
-1 like an afterschool special with costumes by gianni versace , mad love looks better than it feels . 
-1 a passable romantic comedy , in need of another couple of passes through the word processor . 
+1 there is a fabric of complex ideas here , and feelings that profoundly deepen them . 
-1 no worse than a lot of the crap we've been offered this summer , and slightly better than men in black 2 as far as slapdash extraterrestrial comedies go . 
+1 the film does a solid job of slowly , steadily building up to the climactic burst of violence . 
+1 now as a former gong show addict , i'll admit it , my only complaint is that we didn't get more re-creations of all those famous moments from the show . 
+1 defies logic , the laws of physics and almost anyone's willingness to believe in it . but darned if it doesn't also keep us riveted to our seats . 
+1 stands as a document of what it felt like to be a new yorker -- or , really , to be a human being -- in the weeks after 9/11 . 
-1 could the country bears really be as bad as its trailers ? in a word -- yes . 
+1 although laced with humor and a few fanciful touches , the film is a refreshingly serious look at young women . 
+1 it's secondary to american psycho but still has claws enough to get inside you and stay there for a couple of hours . 
-1 the plot is nothing but boilerplate clichés from start to finish , and the script assumes that not only would subtlety be lost on the target audience , but that it's also too stupid to realize that they've already seen this exact same movie a hundred times
+1 remarkable for its intelligence and intensity . 
+1 watstein handily directs and edits around his screenplay's sappier elements . . . and sustains off the hook's buildup with remarkable assuredness for a first-timer . 
-1 the young stars are too cute ; the story and ensuing complications are too manipulative ; the message is too blatant ; the resolutions are too convenient . 
-1 moves in such odd plot directions and descends into such message-mongering moralism that its good qualities are obscured . 
+1 if you're looking for something new and hoping for something entertaining , you're in luck . 
+1 mana gives us compelling , damaged characters who we want to help -- or hurt . 
+1 ms . fulford-wierzbicki is almost spooky in her sulky , calculating lolita turn . 
-1 no reason for anyone to invest their hard-earned bucks into a movie which obviously didn't invest much into itself either . 
-1 the stupidest , most insulting movie of 2002's first quarter . 
-1 buries an interesting storyline about morality and the choices we make underneath such a mountain of clichés and borrowed images that it might more accurately be titled mr . chips off the old block . 
-1 for all the writhing and wailing , tears , rage and opium overdoses , there's no sense of actual passion being washed away in love's dissolution . 
-1 'rare birds' tries to force its quirkiness upon the audience . 
-1 it's push-the-limits teen comedy , the type written by people who can't come up with legitimate funny , and it's used so extensively that good bits are hopelessly overshadowed . 
+1 it's all a rather shapeless good time . . . 
-1 an average b-movie with no aspirations to be anything more . 
+1 it's a ripper of a yarn and i for one enjoyed the thrill of the chill . naomi watts is terrific as rachel ; her petite frame and vulnerable persona emphasising her plight and isolation . 
-1 an earnest racial-issues picture that might have gotten respectful critical praise in a different era -- say , the '60s . 
-1 about as cutting-edge as pet rock : the movie . 
+1 assured , vital and well wrought , the film is , arguably , the most accomplished work to date from hong kong's versatile stanley kwan . 
-1 credit must be given to harland williams , michael rosenbaum and barry watson , who inject far more good-natured spirit and talent into this project than it deserves
-1 this formulaic chiller will do little to boost stallone's career . 
+1 this story of a determined woman's courage to find her husband in a war zone offers winning performances and some effecting moments . 
+1 devotees of star trek ii : the wrath of khan will feel a nagging sense of deja vu , and the grandeur of the best next generation episodes is lacking . 
-1 the disjointed mess flows as naturally as jolie's hideous yellow 'do . 
+1 features what is surely the funniest and most accurate depiction of writer's block ever . 
-1 glazed with a tawdry b-movie scum . 
-1 a zombie movie in every sense of the word--mindless , lifeless , meandering , loud , painful , obnoxious . 
+1 in the pianist , polanski is saying what he has long wanted to say , confronting the roots of his own preoccupations and obsessions , and he allows nothing to get in the way . 
-1 more trifle than triumph . 
-1 the superior plotline isn't quite enough to drag along the dead ( water ) weight of the other . 
-1 it shares the first two films' loose-jointed structure , but laugh-out-loud bits are few and far between . 
-1 unfortunately , neither sendak nor the directors are particularly engaging or articulate . 
+1 the heat of the moment prevails . it cooks conduct in a low , smoky and inviting sizzle . 
-1 not a cheap slasher flick , as the subject matter would suggest , but is a little like a nature film , showing a patient predator and his foolish prey . 
+1 a taut , sobering film . 
+1 the genius of the work speaks volumes , offering up a hallucinatory dreamscape that frustrates and captivates . 
-1 the movie tries to be ethereal , but ends up seeming goofy . 
-1 louiso lets the movie dawdle in classic disaffected-indie-film mode , and brother hoffman's script stumbles over a late-inning twist that just doesn't make sense . 
+1 even though it is infused with the sensibility of a video director , it doesn't make for completely empty entertainment
+1 it's unlikely we'll see a better thriller this year . 
+1 as adapted by kevin molony from simon leys' novel " the death of napoleon " and directed by alan taylor , napoleon's journey is interesting but his parisian rebirth is stillborn
+1 tailored to entertain ! 
-1 the intent is almost exactly the same [as the full monty] . all that's missing is the spontaneity , originality and delight . 
-1 as exciting as all this exoticism might sound to the typical pax viewer , the rest of us will be lulled into a coma . 
-1 shallow . 
+1 y tu mamá también es un buen filme gracias a lo poco convencional de su narrativa , y es quizá el proyecto más arriesgado en la carrera de alfonso cuarón
+1 a powerful , inflammatory film about religion that dares to question an ancient faith , and about hatred that offers no easy , comfortable resolution . 
-1 good-looking but relentlessly lowbrow outing plays like clueless does south fork . 
-1 helmer hudlin tries to make a hip comedy , but his dependence on slapstick defeats the possibility of creating a more darkly edged tome . 
+1 a marvel like none you've seen . 
+1 romanek's themes are every bit as distinctive as his visuals . beyond the cleverness , the weirdness and the pristine camerawork , one hour photo is a sobering meditation on why we take pictures . 
+1 sleek and arty . 
+1 even better than the first one ! 
-1 a smug and convoluted action-comedy that doesn't allow an earnest moment to pass without reminding audiences that it's only a movie . 
+1 a sobering and powerful documentary about the most severe kind of personal loss : rejection by one's mother . 
+1 a compelling coming-of-age drama about the arduous journey of a sensitive young girl through a series of foster homes and a fierce struggle to pull free from her dangerous and domineering mother's hold over her . 
-1 doesn't deliver a great story , nor is the action as gripping as in past seagal films . 
+1 from the big giant titles of the opening credits to elmer bernstein's perfectly melodic score , haynes gets just about everything right . 
+1 the result is somewhat satisfying -- it still comes from spielberg , who has never made anything that wasn't at least watchable . but it's also disappointing to a certain degree . 
+1 tsai ming-liang's witty , wistful new film , what time is it there ? , is a temporal inquiry that shoulders its philosophical burden lightly . 
-1 the movie succumbs to being nothing more than a formulaic chase in the dark . 
-1 apart from dazzling cinematography , we've seen just about everything in blue crush in one form or the other . 
+1 everything about the quiet american is good , except its timing . 
+1 yeah , these flicks are just that damn good . isn't it great ? 
+1 one of the greatest family-oriented , fantasy-adventure movies ever . 
+1 a pleasant , if forgettable , romp of a film . 
-1 never engaging , utterly predictable and completely void of anything remotely interesting or suspenseful . 
+1 an old-fashioned but emotionally stirring adventure tale of the kind they rarely make anymore . 
-1 it's a frightful vanity film that , no doubt , pays off what debt miramax felt they owed to benigni . 
-1 the problem , amazingly enough , is the screenplay . 
-1 arguably the year's silliest and most incoherent movie . 
-1 at every opportunity to do something clever , the film goes right over the edge and kills every sense of believability . . . all you have left is a no-surprise series of explosions and violence while banderas looks like he's not trying to laugh at how bad it
+1 so fiendishly cunning that even the most jaded cinema audiences will leave the auditorium feeling dizzy , confused , and totally disorientated . not to mention absolutely refreshed . 
+1 simultaneously heart-breaking and very funny , the last kiss is really all about performances . 
+1 a gentle blend of present day testimonials , surviving footage of burstein and his family performing , historical archives , and telling stills . 
+1 zhang yimou delivers warm , genuine characters who lie not through dishonesty , but because they genuinely believe it's the only way to bring happiness to their loved ones . 
-1 it's exactly the kind of movie toback's detractors always accuse him of making . 
+1 it provides an honest look at a community striving to anchor itself in new grounds . 
+1 while we no longer possess the lack-of-attention span that we did at seventeen , we had no trouble sitting for blade ii . 
+1 the fact that the rookie is a nearly impeccable cinematic experience -- and a wonderful all-ages triumph besides -- is a miracle akin to the story the film portrays . 
+1 if you enjoy more thoughtful comedies with interesting conflicted characters ; this one is for you . 
-1 think the lion king redone for horses , with fewer deliberate laughs , more inadvertent ones and stunningly trite songs by bryan adams , the world's most generic rock star . 
-1 so muddled , repetitive and ragged that it says far less about the horrifying historical reality than about the filmmaker's characteristic style . 
+1 an intimate contemplation of two marvelously messy lives . 
-1  . . . with the candy-like taste of it fading faster than 25-cent bubble gum , i realized this is a throwaway movie that won't stand the test of time . it's a trifle . 
+1 a genuine mind-bender . 
+1 it is as uncompromising as it is nonjudgmental , and makes clear that a prostitute can be as lonely and needy as any of the clients . 
+1 the film is darkly atmospheric , with herrmann quietly suggesting the sadness and obsession beneath hearst's forced avuncular chortles . 
+1 count on his movie to work at the back of your neck long after you leave the theater . 
+1 you might not buy the ideas . but you'll definitely want the t-shirt . 
-1 an even more predictable , cliche-ridden endeavor than its predecessor . 
+1 long after you leave justine , you'll be wondering what will happen to her and wishing her the best -- whatever that might mean . 
+1 most consumers of lo mein and general tso's chicken barely give a thought to the folks who prepare and deliver it , so , hopefully , this film will attach a human face to all those little steaming cartons . 
+1 a pretty decent kid-pleasing , tolerable-to-adults lark of a movie . 
-1 the only element of suspense is whether the movie will change titles or distributors again before the closing credits roll . 
-1 in the real world , an actor this uncharismatically beautiful would have a résumé loaded with credits like " girl in bar #3 . " 
-1 villeneuve spends too much time wallowing in bibi's generic angst ( there are a lot of shots of her gazing out windows ) . 
+1 a fairly enjoyable mixture of longest yard . . . and the 1999 guy ritchie caper lock stock and two smoking barrels . 
+1 [a] strong piece of work . 
-1 dignified ceo's meet at a rustic retreat and pee against a tree . can you bear the laughter ? 
+1 zany , exuberantly irreverent animated space adventure . 
-1 the result is good gossip , entertainingly delivered , yet with a distinctly musty odour , its expiry date long gone . 
+1 a playful iranian parable about openness , particularly the need for people of diverse political perspectives to get along despite their ideological differences . 
-1 the action quickly sinks into by-the-numbers territory . 
-1 on top of a foundering performance , [madonna's] denied her own athleticism by lighting that emphasizes every line and sag . 
-1 not only unfunny , but downright repellent . 
-1 tries too hard to be funny in a way that's too loud , too goofy and too short of an attention span . 
+1 this nickleby thing might have more homosexual undertones than an eddie murphy film . and just when you think it can't get any more gay , in pops nathan lane . 
+1 this is one of mr . chabrol's subtlest works , but also one of his most uncanny . 
-1 the thrill is ( long ) gone . 
+1 some body will take you places you haven't been , and also places you have . 
-1 it's just disappointingly superficial -- a movie that has all the elements necessary to be a fascinating , involving character study , but never does more than scratch the surface . 
+1 i've never seen or heard anything quite like this film , and i recommend it for its originality alone . 
+1 there's a lot of tooth in roger dodger . but what's nice is that there's a casual intelligence that permeates the script . 
-1 the master of disguise is awful . it's pauly shore awful . don't say you weren't warned . 
-1 johnson has , in his first film , set himself a task he is not nearly up to . 
+1 a refreshingly realistic , affectation-free coming-of-age tale . 
-1 the town has kind of an authentic feel , but each one of these people stand out and everybody else is in the background and it just seems manufactured to me and artificial . 
-1 it's hampered by a lifetime-channel kind of plot and a lead actress who is out of her depth . 
-1 [t]he ideas of revolution #9 are more compelling than the execution
-1 even film silliness needs a little gravity , beyond good hair and humping . 
-1 an uplifting drama . . . what antwone fisher isn't , however , is original . 
-1 every now and again , a movie comes along to remind us of how very bad a motion picture can truly be . frank mcklusky c . i . is that movie ! 
-1 the vampire thriller blade ii starts off as a wild hoot and then sucks the blood out of its fun  toward the end , you can feel your veins cringing from the workout . 
-1 'yes , that's right : it's forrest gump , angel of death . '
+1 one of the most important and exhilarating forms of animated filmmaking since old walt doodled steamboat willie . 
+1 a b-movie you can sit through , enjoy on a certain level and then forget . 
-1 for most movies , 84 minutes is short , but this one feels like a life sentence . 
-1 the whole thing comes off like a particularly amateurish episode of bewitched that takes place during spring break . 
-1 puts on airs of a hal hartley wannabe film -- without the vital comic ingredient of the hilarious writer-director himself . 
+1 majidi gets uniformly engaging performances from his largely amateur cast . 
+1 daring , mesmerizing and exceedingly hard to forget . 
+1 as the movie traces mr . brown's athletic exploits , it is impossible not to be awed by the power and grace of one of the greatest natural sportsmen of modern times . 
-1 a modest and messy metaphysical thriller offering more questions than answers . 
-1 [denis'] bare-bones narrative more closely resembles an outline for a '70s exploitation picture than the finished product . 
-1 it all starts to smack of a hallmark hall of fame , with a few four letter words thrown in that are generally not heard on television . 
-1 pumpkin struts about with " courage " pinned to its huckster lapel while a yellow streak a mile wide decorates its back . 
+1 a map of the inner rhythms of love and jealousy and sacrifice drawn with a master's steady stroke . 
+1 exceptionally well acted by diane lane and richard gere . 
-1 davis the performer is plenty fetching enough , but she needs to shake up the mix , and work in something that doesn't feel like a half-baked stand-up routine . 
-1 bottom-rung new jack city wannabe . 
-1 the most horrific movie experience i've had since " can't stop the music . " it may as well be called " jar-jar binks : the movie . " it's that painful . 
-1 dissing a bond movie is quite like calling a dog stupid , but when it has the temerity to run over two hours , you feel like winding up with a kick . 
-1 the movie attempts to mine laughs from a genre -- the gangster/crime comedy -- that wore out its welcome with audiences several years ago , and its cutesy reliance on movie-specific cliches isn't exactly endearing . 
-1  . . . better described as a ghost story gone badly awry . 
-1 the cast has a high time , but de broca has little enthusiasm for such antique pulp . 
-1 starts promisingly but disintegrates into a dreary , humorless soap opera . 
-1 a dramatic comedy as pleasantly dishonest and pat as any hollywood fluff . 
+1 this delicately observed story , deeply felt and masterfully stylized , is a triumph for its maverick director . 
-1 there is not an ounce of honesty in the entire production . 
-1 yet another iteration of what's become one of the movies' creepiest conventions , in which the developmentally disabled are portrayed with almost supernatural powers to humble , teach and ultimately redeem their mentally " superior " friends , family . . . 
+1 it's the brilliant surfing photography bringing you right inside the massive waves that lifts blue crush into one of the summer's most pleasurable movies . 
+1 you wouldn't call the good girl a date movie ( an anti-date movie is more like it ) , but when it's good , it's good and horrid . 
+1 jeffs has created a breathtakingly assured and stylish work of spare dialogue and acute expressiveness . 
+1 a directorial tour de force by bernard rose , ivans xtc . is one of this year's very best pictures . 
-1 everything is pegged into the groove of a new york dating comedy with 'issues' to simplify . 
+1 gloriously straight from the vagina . 
+1 it is inspirational in characterizing how people from such diverse cultures share the same human and spiritual needs . 
-1 a working class " us vs . them " opera that leaves no heartstring untugged and no liberal cause unplundered . 
+1 the solid filmmaking and convincing characters makes this a high water mark for this genre . 
+1 the film's best trick is the way that it treats conspiracy as a kind of political blair witch , a monstrous murk that haunts us precisely because it can never be seen . 
+1 medem may have disrobed most of the cast , leaving their bodies exposed , but the plot remains as guarded as a virgin with a chastity belt . that's why sex and lucia is so alluring . 
+1 reassuring , retro uplifter . 
+1 whether kiss is a future cult classic or destined to be completely forgotten is open to question , but the risk-takers in the crowd should check it out and form their own opinion . 
-1 the whole thing plays like a tired tyco ad . 
+1 the film oozes craft . 
+1 well-done supernatural thriller with keen insights into parapsychological phenomena and the soulful nuances of the grieving process . 
+1 a compelling , gut-clutching piece of advocacy cinema that carries you along in a torrent of emotion as it explores the awful complications of one terrifying day . 
-1 the actresses may have worked up a back story for the women they portray so convincingly , but viewers don't get enough of that background for the characters to be involving as individuals rather than types . 
-1 as immaculate as stuart little 2 is , it could be a lot better if it were , well , more adventurous . 
+1 passable entertainment , but it's the kind of motion picture that won't make much of a splash when it's released , and will not be remembered long afterwards . 
+1 moonlight mile gives itself the freedom to feel contradictory things . it is sentimental but feels free to offend , is analytical and then surrenders to the illogic of its characters , is about grief and yet permits laughter . 
+1 captivates and shows how a skillful filmmaker can impart a message without bludgeoning the audience over the head . 
-1 while the production details are lavish , film has little insight into the historical period and its artists , particularly in how sand developed a notorious reputation . 
-1 this is a great subject for a movie , but hollywood has squandered the opportunity , using it as a prop for warmed-over melodrama and the kind of choreographed mayhem that director john woo has built his career on . 
-1 though it draws several decent laughs , it's low-cal woody at best . 
-1 characters still need to function according to some set of believable and comprehensible impulses , no matter how many drugs they do or how much artistic license avary employs . 
+1 this is a gorgeous film - vivid with color , music and life . delight your senses and crash this wedding ! 
-1 walsh can't quite negotiate the many inconsistencies in janice's behavior or compensate for them by sheer force of charm . 
+1 this is as powerful a set of evidence as you'll ever find of why art matters , and how it can resonate far beyond museum walls and through to the most painfully marginal lives . 
-1 even the finest chef can't make a hotdog into anything more than a hotdog , and robert de niro can't make this movie anything more than a trashy cop buddy comedy . 
-1 no one but a convict guilty of some truly heinous crime should have to sit through the master of disguise . 
+1 there are some movies that hit you from the first scene and you know it's going to be a trip . igby goes down is one of those movies . 
-1 some episodes work , some don't . 
-1 juliette binoche's sand is vivacious , but it's hard to sense that powerhouse of 19th-century prose behind her childlike smile . 
-1 i suspect that you'll be as bored watching morvern callar as the characters are in it . if you go , pack your knitting needles . 
+1 buy popcorn . take nothing seriously and enjoy the ride . 
+1 whatever one makes of its political edge , this is beautiful filmmaking from one of french cinema's master craftsmen . 
-1 not completely loveable -- but what underdog movie since the bad news bears has been ? -- but certainly hard to hate . 
+1 it cuts to the core of what it actually means to face your fears , to be a girl in a world of boys , to be a boy truly in love with a girl , and to ride the big metaphorical wave that is life -- wherever it takes you . 
+1 it's bright , pristine style and bold colors make it as much fun as reading an oversized picture book before bedtime . 
+1 it may sound like a mere disease-of- the-week tv movie , but a song for martin is made infinitely more wrenching by the performances of real-life spouses seldahl and wollter . 
-1 seems like someone going through the motions . 
-1 this heist flick about young brooklyn hoods is off the shelf after two years to capitalize on the popularity of vin diesel , seth green and barry pepper . it should have stayed there . 
-1 a momentary escape from the summer heat and the sedentary doldrums that set in at this time of year . 
-1 it's just rather leaden and dull . 
+1 a modestly surprising movie . 
-1 whaley's determination to immerse you in sheer , unrelenting wretchedness is exhausting . 
+1 [the digital effects] reminded me of terry gilliam's rudimentary old monty python cartoons , in which he would cut out figures from drawings and photographs and paste them together . 
-1 this mess of a movie is nothing short of a travesty of a transvestite comedy . 
+1 jarecki and gibney do find enough material to bring kissinger's record into question and explain how the diplomat's tweaked version of statecraft may have cost thousands and possibly millions of lives . 
+1 the evocative imagery and gentle , lapping rhythms of this film are infectious -- it gets under our skin and draws us in long before the plot kicks into gear . 
-1 the title , alone , should scare any sane person away . 
+1 the wanton slipperiness of * corpus and its amiable jerking and reshaping of physical time and space would make it a great piece to watch with kids and use to introduce video as art . 
+1 brings to a spectacular completion one of the most complex , generous and subversive artworks of the last decade . 
+1 the cat's meow marks a return to form for director peter bogdanovich . . . 
+1 a fascinating literary mystery story with multiple strands about the controversy of who really wrote shakespeare's plays . 
+1 the audacity to view one of shakespeare's better known tragedies as a dark comedy is , by itself , deserving of discussion . 
+1 a sensitive , cultivated treatment of greene's work as well as a remarkably faithful one . 
-1 i'm sorry to say that this should seal the deal - arnold is not , nor will he be , back . 
+1 it's funny , as the old saying goes , because it's true . 
-1 i can imagine this movie as a b&w british comedy , circa 1960 , with peter sellers , kenneth williams , et al . , but at this time , with this cast , this movie is hopeless . 
-1 this is rote spookiness , with nary an original idea ( or role , or edit , or score , or anything , really ) in sight , and the whole of the proceedings beg the question 'why ? '
+1 a refreshing korean film about five female high school friends who face an uphill battle when they try to take their relationships into deeper waters . 
-1 a good-natured ensemble comedy that tries hard to make the most of a bumper cast , but never quite gets off the ground . 
-1 it has become apparent that the franchise's best years are long past . 
-1 just a collection of this and that -- whatever fills time -- with no unified whole . 
-1 wanker goths are on the loose ! run for your lives ! 
+1 birthday girl doesn't try to surprise us with plot twists , but rather seems to enjoy its own transparency . 
+1  " 13 conversations " holds its goodwill close , but is relatively slow to come to the point . 
+1 hashiguchi uses the situation to evoke a japan bustling atop an undercurrent of loneliness and isolation . 
-1 historical dramas fused with love triangle is a well worn conceit . but this films lacks the passion required to sell the material .

+1 broomfield reminds us that beneath the hype , the celebrity , the high life , the conspiracies and the mystery there were once a couple of bright young men -- promising , talented , charismatic and tragically doomed . 
+1 most impressive , though , is the film's open-ended finale that refuses to entirely close its characters' emotional wounds . 
-1 this is a movie that starts out like heathers , then becomes bring it on , then becomes unwatchable . 
-1 to the filmmakers , ivan is a prince of a fellow , but he comes across as shallow and glib though not mean-spirited , and there's no indication that he's been responsible for putting together any movies of particular value or merit . 
-1 journalistically dubious , inept and often lethally dull . 
-1 doesn't amount to much of anything . 
-1 national lampoon's van wilder could be the worst thing to come out of national lampoon since class reunion
-1 the story . . . is moldy and obvious . 
+1 top-notch action powers this romantic drama . 
+1 the film overcomes the regular minefield of coming-of-age cliches with potent doses of honesty and sensitivity . 
-1 director uwe boll and writer robert dean klein fail to generate any interest in an unsympathetic hero caught up in an intricate plot that while cleverly worked out , cannot overcome blah characters . 
-1 thriller directorial debut for traffic scribe gaghan has all the right parts , but the pieces don't quite fit together . 
+1 elvira fans could hardly ask for more . 
-1 this hastily mounted production exists only to capitalize on hopkins' inclination to play hannibal lecter again , even though harris has no immediate inclination to provide a fourth book . 
+1 shainberg weaves a carefully balanced scenario that is controlled by neither character , is weirdly sympathetic to both and manages to be tender and darkly comic . 
+1 a rarity among recent iranian films : it's a comedy full of gentle humor that chides the absurdity of its protagonist's plight . 
+1 what emerges is an unsettling picture of childhood innocence combined with indoctrinated prejudice . promises is a compelling piece that demonstrates just how well children can be trained to live out and carry on their parents' anguish . 
+1 reggio and glass put on an intoxicating show . 
-1 borstal boy represents the worst kind of filmmaking , the kind that pretends to be passionate and truthful but is really frustratingly timid and soggy . 
-1 the problem with the bread , my sweet is that it's far too sentimental . 
-1 an authentically vague , but ultimately purposeless , study in total pandemonium . 
-1 get out your pooper-scoopers . 
+1  . . . a spoof comedy that carries its share of laughs  sometimes a chuckle , sometimes a guffaw and , to my great pleasure , the occasional belly laugh . 
-1 it never quite makes it to the boiling point , but manages to sustain a good simmer for most of its running time . 
-1 when [reno] lets her radical flag fly , taking angry potshots at george w . bush , henry kissinger , larry king , et al . , reno devolves into a laugh-free lecture . 
-1 what's missing is what we call the 'wow' factor . 
+1 watching these eccentrics is both inspiring and pure joy . 
+1 unfolds in a series of achronological vignettes whose cumulative effect is chilling . 
+1 with a romantic comedy plotline straight from the ages , this cinderella story doesn't have a single surprise up its sleeve . but it does somehow manage to get you under its spell . 
+1 using a stock plot , about a boy injects just enough freshness into the proceedings to provide an enjoyable 100 minutes in a movie theater . 
-1 this is an insultingly inept and artificial examination of grief and its impacts upon the relationships of the survivors . 
-1 impostor doesn't do much with its template , despite a remarkably strong cast . 
+1 a solid piece of journalistic work that draws a picture of a man for whom political expedience became a deadly foreign policy . 
+1 a film of epic scale with an intimate feeling , a saga of the ups and downs of friendships . 
-1 directors harry gantz and joe gantz have chosen a fascinating subject matter , but the couples exposing themselves aren't all that interesting . 
+1 sparkling , often hilarious romantic jealousy comedy . . . attal looks so much like a young robert deniro that it seems the film should instead be called 'my husband is travis bickle' . 
-1 just plain silly . 
+1 funny and touching . 
-1 it's quite an achievement to set and shoot a movie at the cannes film festival and yet fail to capture its visual appeal or its atmosphere . 
+1  " frailty " has been written so well , that even a simple " goddammit ! " near the end takes on a whole other meaning . 
+1 skins has a desolate air , but eyre , a native american raised by white parents , manages to infuse the rocky path to sibling reconciliation with flashes of warmth and gentle humor . 
+1 though a capable thriller , somewhere along the way k-19 jettisoned some crucial drama . 
-1 [stevens is] so stoked to make an important film about human infidelity and happenstance that he tosses a kitchen sink onto a story already overladen with plot conceits . 
-1 enigma is well-made , but it's just too dry and too placid . 
-1 a waterlogged version of 'fatal attraction' for the teeny-bopper set . . . a sad , soggy potboiler that wastes the talents of its attractive young leads . 
-1 solondz may well be the only one laughing at his own joke
-1 there's too much forced drama in this wildly uneven movie , about a young man's battle with his inescapable past and uncertain future in a very shapable but largely unfulfilling present . 
+1 [chaiken's] talent lies in an evocative , accurate observation of a distinctive milieu and in the lively , convincing dialogue she creates for her characters . 
+1 there is no denying the power of polanski's film . . . 
-1 pompous and garbled . 
+1 an exhilarating futuristic thriller-noir , minority report twists the best of technology around a gripping story , delivering a riveting , pulse intensifying escapist adventure of the first order
-1 if this dud had been made in the '70s , it would have been called the hills have antlers and played for about three weeks in drive-ins . 
+1 the bai brothers have taken an small slice of history and opened it up for all of us to understand , and they've told a nice little story in the process . 
-1 just dreadful . i don't blame eddie murphy but shouldn't owen wilson know a movie must have a story and a script ? 
+1 an epic of grandeur and scale that's been decades gone from the popcorn pushing sound stages of hollywood . 
-1 there isn't nearly enough fun here , despite the presence of some appealing ingredients . 
+1 majidi is an unconventional storyteller , capable of finding beauty in the most depressing places . 
-1 highly uneven and inconsistent . . . margarita happy hour kinda resembles the el cheapo margaritas served within . 
-1 love liza is a festival film that would have been better off staying on the festival circuit . 
+1 for a movie audience , the hours doesn't connect in a neat way , but introduces characters who illuminate mysteries of sex , duty and love . 
+1 at once emotional and richly analytical , the cosby-seinfeld encounter alone confirms the serious weight behind this superficially loose , larky documentary . 
+1 pipe dream does have its charms . the leads are natural and lovely , the pace is serene , the humor wry and sprightly . 
+1 the movie ultimately relies a bit too heavily on grandstanding , emotional , rocky-like moments . . . but it's such a warm and charming package that you'll feel too happy to argue much . 
-1 a long slog for anyone but the most committed pokemon fan . 
-1 director ferzan ozpetek creates an interesting dynamic with the members of this group , who live in the same apartment building . but he loses his focus when he concentrates on any single person . 
+1 unpretentious , charming , quirky , original
-1 another wholly unnecessary addition to the growing , moldering pile of , well , extreme stunt pictures . 
+1 the best movie in many a moon about the passions that sometimes fuel our best achievements and other times leave us stranded with nothing more than our lesser appetites . 
+1 succeeds as a well-made evocation of a subculture . 
+1 entirely suspenseful , extremely well-paced and ultimately . . . dare i say , entertaining ! 
+1 the formula is familiar but enjoyable . 
-1 without a strong script and energetic acting , dogma films can produce the same sleep-inducing effects as watching your neighbor's home videos . 
-1 bean drops the ball too many times . . . hoping the nifty premise will create enough interest to make up for an unfocused screenplay . 
-1 i wish it would have just gone more over-the-top instead of trying to have it both ways . 
-1 a film really has to be exceptional to justify a three hour running time , and this isn't . 
-1 with mcconaughey in an entirely irony-free zone and bale reduced mainly to batting his sensitive eyelids , there's not enough intelligence , wit or innovation on the screen to attract and sustain an older crowd . 
+1 it's one thing to read about or rail against the ongoing - and unprecedented - construction project going on over our heads . it's quite another to feel physically caught up in the process . 
+1 the santa clause 2 proves itself a more streamlined and thought out encounter than the original could ever have hoped to be . 
+1 cho continues her exploration of the outer limits of raunch with considerable brio . 
+1 the band's courage in the face of official repression is inspiring , especially for aging hippies ( this one included ) . 
+1 although it lacks the detail of the book , the film does pack some serious suspense . 
-1 it all drags on so interminably it's like watching a miserable relationship unfold in real time . 
-1 the april 2002 instalment of the american war for independence , complete with loads of cgi and bushels of violence , but not a drop of human blood . 
+1 what i saw , i enjoyed . 
+1  . . . rogers's mouth never stops shut about the war between the sexes and how to win the battle . 
+1 tully is worth a look for its true-to-life characters , its sensitive acting , its unadorned view of rural life and the subtle direction of first-timer hilary birmingham . 
+1 denis and co-writer michele petin's impeccable screenplay penetrates with a rawness that that is both unflinching and tantalizing . lead provocatuers testud and parmentier give superlative performances
-1 though avary has done his best to make something out of ellis' nothing novel , in the end , his rules is barely worth following . 
-1 the package in which this fascinating -- and timely -- content comes wrapped is disappointingly generic . 
+1 despite the 2-d animation , the wild thornberrys movie makes for a surprisingly cinematic experience . 
+1 in adobo , ethnicity is not just the spice , but at the heart of more universal concerns . 
-1 what might've been an exhilarating exploration of an odd love triangle becomes a sprawl of uncoordinated vectors . 
-1 sweet gentle jesus , did the screenwriters just do a cut-and-paste of every bad action-movie line in history ? 
-1 the film's needlessly opaque intro takes its doe-eyed crudup out of pre-9/11 new york and onto a cross-country road trip of the homeric kind . 
+1 there is no solace here , no entertainment value , merely a fierce lesson in where filmmaking can take us . 
-1 the filmmakers are playing to the big boys in new york and l . a . to that end , they mock the kind of folks they don't understand , ones they figure the power-lunchers don't care to understand , either . 
-1 leaves you with a knot in your stomach , its power is undercut by its own head-banging obviousness . 
+1 yes , it's as good as you remember . in fact , even better . 
-1 the problem with concept films is that if the concept is a poor one , there's no saving the movie . sorry , charlie
+1 a perfectly respectable , perfectly inoffensive , easily forgettable film . 
+1 predictable storyline and by-the-book scripting is all but washed away by sumptuous ocean visuals and the cinematic stylings of director john stockwell . 
-1 a broadly played , lowbrow comedy in which the cast delivers mildly amusing performances and no farm animals were injured by any of the gags . 
-1 they do a good job of painting this family dynamic for the audience but they tried to squeeze too many elements into the film . 
+1 intriguing and stylish . 
+1 offers a persuasive look at a defeated but defiant nation in flux . 
-1 what you expect is just what you get . . . assuming the bar of expectations hasn't been raised above sixth-grade height . 
-1 new best friend shouldn't have gone straight to video ; it should have gone straight to a mystery science theater 3000 video . 
-1 a punch line without a premise , a joke built entirely from musty memories of half-dimensional characters . 
-1 what remains is a variant of the nincompoop benigni persona , here a more annoying , though less angry version of the irresponsible sandlerian manchild , undercut by the voice of the star of road trip . 
-1 i'll go out on a limb . it isn't quite one of the worst movies of the year . it's just merely very bad . 
-1 dawdles and drags when it should pop ; it doesn't even have the virtue of enough mindless violence to break up the tedium of all its generational bonding . 
-1 plodding , peevish and gimmicky . 
+1 nair doesn't use [monsoon wedding] to lament the loss of culture . instead , she sees it as a chance to revitalize what is and always has been remarkable about clung-to traditions . 
-1 when the precise nature of matthew's predicament finally comes into sharp focus , the revelation fails to justify the build-up . 
+1 a first-class road movie that proves you can run away from home , but your ego and all your problems go with you . 
+1 so young , so smart , such talent , such a wise * * * . 
+1 the wild thornberrys movie is a jolly surprise . 
-1 jones helps breathe some life into the insubstantial plot , but even he is overwhelmed by predictability . 
+1 [scherfig] has made a movie that will leave you wondering about the characters' lives after the clever credits roll . 
+1 the saturation bombing of reggio's images and glass' evocative music . . . ultimately leaves viewers with the task of divining meaning . 
+1 like the film's almost anthropologically detailed realization of early-'80s suburbia , it's significant without being overstated . 
+1 the asylum material is gripping , as are the scenes of jia with his family . 
+1 the film may appear naked in its narrative form . . . but it goes deeper than that , to fundamental choices that include the complexity of the catholic doctrine
-1 julie davis is the kathie lee gifford of film directors , sadly proving once again ego doesn't always go hand in hand with talent . 
+1 a moody , multi-dimensional love story and sci-fi mystery , solaris is a thought-provoking , haunting film that allows the seeds of the imagination to germinate . 
-1  . . . while certainly clever in spots , this too-long , spoofy update of shakespeare's macbeth doesn't sustain a high enough level of invention . 
+1 frei assembles a fascinating profile of a deeply humanistic artist who , in spite of all that he's witnessed , remains surprisingly idealistic , and retains an extraordinary faith in the ability of images to communicate the truth of the world around him . 
+1 presents an astute appraisal of middle american musical torpor and the desperate struggle to escape it . 
+1 worth catching for griffiths' warm and winning central performance . 
-1 jaglom offers the none-too-original premise that everyone involved with moviemaking is a con artist and a liar . 
+1 the sundance film festival has become so buzz-obsessed that fans and producers descend upon utah each january to ferret out the next great thing . 'tadpole' was one of the films so declared this year , but it's really more of the next pretty good thing . 
+1 not the best herzog perhaps , but unmistakably herzog . 
+1 an experience so engrossing it is like being buried in a new environment . 
+1 haynes has so fanatically fetishized every bizarre old-movie idiosyncrasy with such monastic devotion you're not sure if you should applaud or look into having him committed . 
+1 a coming-of-age film that avoids the cartoonish clichés and sneering humor of the genre as it provides a fresh view of an old type -- the uncertain girl on the brink of womanhood . 
+1 it's not a great monster movie . but if you've paid a matinee price and bought a big tub of popcorn , there's guilty fun to be had here . chomp chomp ! 
+1 a movie for 11-year-old boys with sports dreams of their own and the preteen girls who worship lil' bow wow . 
-1 if this holiday movie is supposed to be a gift , somebody unwrapped it early , took out all the good stuff , and left behind the crap ( literally ) . 
-1 as an actor's showcase , hart's war has much to recommend it , even if the top-billed willis is not the most impressive player . as a story of dramatic enlightenment , the screenplay by billy ray and terry george leaves something to be desired . 
+1 this is one of the year's best films . 
-1 too much of the movie feels contrived , as if the filmmakers were worried the story wouldn't work without all those gimmicks . 
+1 fine acting but there is no sense of connecting the dots , just dots . 
-1 [a] stuporously solemn film . 
-1 some body smacks of exhibitionism more than it does cathartic truth telling . 
+1 hilarious , touching and wonderfully dyspeptic . 
+1 like the best of godard's movies . . . it is visually ravishing , penetrating , impenetrable . 
-1 mattei's underdeveloped effort here is nothing but a convenient conveyor belt of brooding personalities that parade about as if they were coming back from stock character camp -- a drowsy drama infatuated by its own pretentious self-examination . 
-1 halfway through the movie , the humor dwindles . it's replaced by some dramatic scenes that are jarring and deeply out of place in what could have ( and probably should have ) been a lighthearted comedy . 
-1  . . . fifty minutes of tedious adolescent melodramatics followed by thirty-five minutes of inflated nonsense . 
-1 half of it is composed of snappy patter and pseudo-sophisticated cultural observations , while the remainder . . . would be more at home on a daytime television serial . 
+1 a mess , but it's a sincere mess . 
+1 very predictable but still entertaining
+1 the inspirational screenplay by mike rich covers a lot of ground , perhaps too much , but ties things together , neatly , by the end . 
+1 full of detail about the man and his country , and is well worth seeing . 
-1 the performances are so leaden , michael rymer's direction is so bloodless and the dialogue is so corny that the audience laughs out loud . 
-1 a reality-snubbing hodgepodge . 
-1 those eternally devoted to the insanity of black will have an intermittently good time . feel free to go get popcorn whenever he's not onscreen . 
-1 there's an epic here , but you have to put it together yourself . 
+1 jason x has cheesy effects and a hoary plot , but its macabre , self-deprecating sense of humor makes up for a lot . 
-1 the film's stagecrafts are intimate and therefore bolder than the otherwise calculated artifice that defines and overwhelms the film's production design . 
+1 as i settled into my world war ii memories , i found myself strangely moved by even the corniest and most hackneyed contrivances . 
+1 an undeniably moving film to experience , and ultimately that's what makes it worth a recommendation . 
-1 the premise is in extremely bad taste , and the film's supposed insights are so poorly thought-out and substance-free that even a high school senior taking his or her first psychology class could dismiss them . 
+1 a swashbuckling tale of love , betrayal , revenge and above all , faith . 
+1 a smart , witty follow-up . 
+1 'anyone with a passion for cinema , and indeed sex , should see it as soon as possible . '
+1 i'm not generally a fan of vegetables but this batch is pretty cute . 
+1 it may not be a huge cut of above the rest , but i enjoyed barbershop . it's a funny little movie with clever dialogue and likeable characters . 
-1 woody allen has really found his groove these days . the problem is that it is one that allows him to churn out one mediocre movie after another . 
-1 [the film's] taste for " shock humor " will wear thin on all but those weaned on the comedy of tom green and the farrelly brothers . 
+1 remember the kind of movie we were hoping " ecks vs . sever " or " xxx " was going to be ? this is it . 
+1 two weeks notice has appeal beyond being a sandra bullock vehicle or a standard romantic comedy . 
-1 it is one more celluloid testimonial to the cruelties experienced by southern blacks as distilled through a caucasian perspective . 
+1 the film runs on a little longer than it needs to -- muccino either doesn't notice when his story ends or just can't tear himself away from the characters -- but it's smooth and professional . 
+1 mostly martha could have used a little trimming -- 10 or 15 minutes could be cut and no one would notice -- but it's a pleasurable trifle . the only pain you'll feel as the credits roll is your stomach grumbling for some tasty grub . 
+1 a taut , intelligent psychological drama . 
-1 it's a frankenstein-monster of a film that doesn't know what it wants to be . 
-1 it's surprisingly bland despite the heavy doses of weird performances and direction . 
+1 peralta captures , in luminous interviews and amazingly evocative film from three decades ago , the essence of the dogtown experience . 
+1 this engrossing , characteristically complex tom clancy thriller is shifty in the manner in which it addresses current terrorism anxieties and sidesteps them at the same time . 
+1 a bittersweet drama about the limbo of grief and how truth-telling can open the door to liberation . 
+1 the weight of the piece , the unerring professionalism of the chilly production , and the fascination embedded in the lurid topic prove recommendation enough . 
-1 coupling disgracefully written dialogue with flailing bodily movements that substitute for acting , circuit is the awkwardly paced soap opera-ish story . 
+1 arliss howard's ambitious , moving , and adventurous directorial debut , big bad love , meets so many of the challenges it poses for itself that one can forgive the film its flaws . 
-1 once ice-t sticks his mug in the window of the couple's bmw and begins haranguing the wife in bad stage dialogue , all credibility flies out the window . 
+1 a brutal and funny work . nicole holofcenter , the insightful writer/director responsible for this illuminating comedy doesn't wrap the proceedings up neatly but the ideas tie together beautifully . 
+1 a love for films shines through each frame and the era is recreated with obvious affection , scored to perfection with some tasty boogaloo beats . 
-1  . . . plays like somebody spliced random moments of a chris rock routine into what is otherwise a cliche-riddled but self-serious spy thriller . 
-1 if all of eight legged freaks was as entertaining as the final hour , i would have no problem giving it an unqualified recommendation . 
-1 a dreary , incoherent , self-indulgent mess of a movie in which a bunch of pompous windbags drone on inanely for two hours . . . a cacophony of pretentious , meaningless prattle . 
-1 the reason i found myself finally unmoved by this film , which is immaculately produced and has serious things to say , is that it comes across rather too plainly as allegory . 
+1 the enjoyable undercover brother , a zany mix of saturday night live-style parody , '70s blaxploitation films and goofball action comedy gone wild , dishes out a ton of laughs that everyone can enjoy . 
-1 the sum of all fears pretends to be a serious exploration of nuclear terrorism , but it's really nothing more than warmed-over cold war paranoia . 
+1 a soul-stirring documentary about the israeli/palestinian conflict as revealed through the eyes of some children who remain curious about each other against all odds . 
+1 steers refreshingly clear of the usual cliches . 
+1 lightweight but appealing . 
-1 ostensibly celebrates middle-aged girl power , even as it presents friendship between women as pathetic , dysfunctional and destructive . 
+1 earnest , unsubtle and hollywood-predictable , green dragon is still a deeply moving effort to put a human face on the travail of thousands of vietnamese . 
+1 an old-fashioned scary movie , one that relies on lingering terror punctuated by sudden shocks and not constant bloodshed punctuated by flying guts . 
-1 though it goes further than both , anyone who has seen the hunger or cat people will find little new here , but a tasty performance from vincent gallo lifts this tale of cannibal lust above the ordinary . 
+1 the one-liners are snappy , the situations volatile and the comic opportunities richly rewarded . 
-1 plot , characters , drama , emotions , ideas -- all are irrelevant to the experience of seeing the scorpion king . 
-1 curling may be a unique sport but men with brooms is distinctly ordinary . 
-1 any chekhov is better than no chekhov , but it would be a shame if this was your introduction to one of the greatest plays of the last 100 years . 
+1 time out is existential drama without any of the pretension associated with the term . 
-1 his best film remains his shortest , the hole , which makes many of the points that this film does but feels less repetitive . 
+1 a fascinating , bombshell documentary that should shame americans , regardless of whether or not ultimate blame finally lies with kissinger . should be required viewing for civics classes and would-be public servants alike . 
-1 if the title is a jeopardy question , then the answer might be " how does steven seagal come across these days ? " or maybe " how will you feel after an 88-minute rip-off of the rock with action confined to slo-mo gun firing and random glass-shattering ? 
+1 in other words , it's just another sports drama/character study . yet this one makes up for in heart what it lacks in outright newness . plus , like i already mentioned . . . it's robert duvall ! c'mon ! 
-1 complete lack of originality , cleverness or even visible effort
+1 cockettes has the glorious , gaudy benefit of much stock footage of those days , featuring all manner of drag queen , bearded lady and lactating hippie . 
+1 i can't say that i liked homeboy ; it'd be more accurate to say that i found it intriguing , bizarre , dogma-like in spots - and quite truthful , in its way . 
+1 me no lika da accents so good , but i thoroughly enjoyed the love story . scott baio is turning in some delightful work on indie projects . 
-1 opens at a funeral , ends on the protagonist's death bed and doesn't get much livelier in the three hours in between . 
-1 a rambling ensemble piece with loosely connected characters and plots that never quite gel . 
-1 lacks depth . 
-1 too bland and fustily tasteful to be truly prurient . 
-1 we can't accuse kung pow for misfiring , since it is exactly what it wants to be : an atrociously , mind-numbingly , indescribably bad movie . unfortunately , we'd prefer a simple misfire . 
-1 this piece of channel 5 grade trash is , quite frankly , an insult to the intelligence of the true genre enthusiast . 
+1 real women may have many agendas , but it also will win you over , in a big way . 
-1 odd and weird . 
+1 the drama is played out with such aching beauty and truth that it brings tears to your eyes . 
+1  " birthday girl " is an actor's movie first and foremost . 
+1 the underworld urban angst is derivative of martin scorsese's taxi driver and goodfellas , but this film speaks for itself . 
-1 billy crystal and robert de niro sleepwalk through vulgarities in a sequel you can refuse . 
+1 even with all those rough edges safely sanded down , the american insomnia is still pretty darned good . 
-1 parker updates the setting in an attempt to make the film relevant today , without fully understanding what it was that made the story relevant in the first place . 
+1 soderbergh skims the fat from the 1972 film . what's left is a rich stew of longing . 
-1 an erotic thriller that's neither too erotic nor very thrilling , either . 
-1 vile and tacky are the two best adjectives to describe ghost ship . 
+1 i couldn't recommend this film more . 
+1 all in all , it's a pretty good execution of a story that's a lot richer than the ones hollywood action screenwriters usually come up with on their own . 
+1 good actors have a radar for juicy roles -- there's a plethora of characters in this picture , and not one of them is flat . 
+1 isabelle huppert excels as the enigmatic mika and anna mouglalis is a stunning new young talent in one of chabrol's most intense psychological mysteries . 
-1 remember back when thrillers actually thrilled ? when the twist endings were actually surprising ? when the violence actually shocked ? when the heroes were actually under 40 ? sadly , as blood work proves , that was a long , long time ago . 
-1 lucas has in fact come closer than anyone could desire to the cheap , graceless , hackneyed sci-fi serials of the '30s and '40s . 
-1 as a movie , it never seems fresh and vital . it never plays as dramatic even when dramatic things happen to people . it labours as storytelling . 
-1 a predictable and stereotypical little b-movie . 
-1 during the tuxedo's 90 minutes of screen time , there isn't one true 'chan moment' . 
-1  . . . an airless , prepackaged julia roberts wannabe that stinks so badly of hard-sell image-mongering you'll wonder if lopez's publicist should share screenwriting credit . 
-1 the movie is like scorsese's mean streets redone by someone who ignored it in favor of old 'juvenile delinquent' paperbacks with titles like leather warriors and switchblade sexpot . 
+1 the smartest bonehead comedy of the summer . 
+1 the filmmakers' eye for detail and the high standards of performance convey a strong sense of the girls' environment . 
-1 the script , the gags , the characters are all direct-to-video stuff , and that's where this film should have remained . 
-1 it's another stale , kill-by-numbers flick , complete with blade-thin characters and terrible , pun-laden dialogue . 
-1 as it stands , crocodile hunter has the hurried , badly cobbled look of the 1959 godzilla , which combined scenes of a japanese monster flick with canned shots of raymond burr commenting on the monster's path of destruction . 
-1 when the painted backdrops in a movie are more alive than its characters , you know you're in trouble . 
+1 the most consistently funny of the austin powers films . 
-1 the explosion essentially ruined -- or , rather , overpowered -- the fiction of the movie for me . 
+1 less front-loaded and more shapely than the two-hour version released here in 1990 . 
+1 kaufman creates an eerie sense of not only being there at the time of these events but the very night matthew was killed . 
-1 unlike his directorial efforts , la femme nikita and the professional , the transporter lacks besson's perspective as a storyteller . 
-1 includes too much obvious padding . 
+1 a time machine , a journey back to your childhood , when cares melted away in the dark theater , and films had the ability to mesmerize , astonish and entertain . 
-1 in the process of trimming the movie to an expeditious 84 minutes , director roger kumble seems to have dumped a whole lot of plot in favor of . . . outrageous gags . 
-1 a farce of a parody of a comedy of a premise , it isn't a comparison to reality so much as it is a commentary about our knowledge of films . 
+1 it's a good film , but it falls short of its aspiration to be a true 'epic' . 
-1 unofficially , national lampoon's van wilder is son of animal house . officially , it is twice as bestial but half as funny . 
+1 a zinger-filled crowd-pleaser that open-minded elvis fans ( but by no means all ) will have fun with . 
-1 rarely has a film's title served such dire warning . 
-1 herzog is obviously looking for a moral to his fable , but the notion that a strong , unified showing among germany and eastern european jews might have changed 20th-century history is undermined by ahola's inadequate performance . 
-1 its screenplay serves as auto-critique , and its clumsiness as its own most damning censure . 
-1 eh . 
-1 this is very much of a mixed bag , with enough negatives to outweigh the positives . 
+1 that rare documentary that incorporates so much of human experience -- drama , conflict , tears and surprise -- that it transcends the normal divisions between fiction and nonfiction film . 
+1 the special effects and many scenes of weightlessness look as good or better than in the original , while the oscar-winning sound and james horner's rousing score make good use of the hefty audio system . 
-1 i felt trapped and with no obvious escape for the entire 100 minutes .

-1 this version of h . g . wells' time machine was directed by h . g . wells' great-grandson . they should have found orson welles' great-grandson . 
+1 a different and emotionally reserved type of survival story -- a film less about refracting all of world war ii through the specific conditions of one man , and more about that man lost in its midst . 
-1 strong setup and ambitious goals fade as the film descends into unsophisticated scare tactics and b-film thuggery . 
+1 the film is an enjoyable family film -- pretty much aimed at any youngster who loves horses . 
-1 what 'blade runner' would've looked like as a low-budget series on a uhf channel . 
+1 sometimes we feel as if the film careens from one colorful event to another without respite , but sometimes it must have seemed to frida kahlo as if her life did , too . 
-1 every so often a movie comes along that confirms one's worse fears about civilization as we know it . the new guy is one of them . 
+1 a funny and well-contructed black comedy where the old adage " be careful what you wish for " is given a full workout . 
-1 van wilder brings a whole new meaning to the phrase 'comedy gag . ' at least one scene is so disgusting that viewers may be hard pressed to retain their lunch . 
+1 the film's performances are thrilling . 
+1 an unflinching , complex portrait of a modern israel that is rarely seen on-screen . 
+1 you'll laugh at either the obviousness of it all or its stupidity or maybe even its inventiveness , but the point is , you'll laugh . 
+1 succeeds where its recent predecessor miserably fails because it demands that you suffer the dreadfulness of war from both sides .

+1 beautiful to watch and holds a certain charm . 
-1 if you've ever entertained the notion of doing what the title of this film implies , what sex with strangers actually shows may put you off the idea forever . 
+1 scores a few points for doing what it does with a dedicated and good-hearted professionalism . 
+1  . . . a triumph of emotionally and narratively complex filmmaking . 
+1 evokes a little of the fear that parents have for the possible futures of their children--and the sometimes bad choices mothers and fathers make in the interests of doing them good . 
+1 poignant and delicately complex . 
+1 the director explores all three sides of his story with a sensitivity and an inquisitiveness reminiscent of truffaut . 
+1 this movie has the usual impossible stunts . . . but it has just as many scenes that are lean and tough enough to fit in any modern action movie . 
-1 its strengths and weaknesses play off each other virtually to a stand-off , with the unfortunate trump card being the dreary mid-section of the film . 
+1 the movie is . . . very funny as you peek at it through the fingers in front of your eyes . 
-1 while american adobo has its heart ( and its palate ) in the right place , its brain is a little scattered -- ditsy , even .

+1 see scratch for the history , see scratch for the music , see scratch for a lesson in scratching , but , most of all , see it for the passion . 
+1 i whole-heartedly recommend that everyone see this movie-- for its historical significance alone . 
+1 deliciously mean-spirited and wryly observant . 
+1 [it's] a clever thriller with enough unexpected twists to keep our interest . 
+1 despite its floating narrative , this is a remarkably accessible and haunting film . 
+1 a sweet-tempered comedy that forgoes the knee-jerk misogyny that passes for humor in so many teenage comedies . 
+1 if villainous vampires are your cup of blood , blade 2 is definitely a cut above the rest . 
+1 it's the perfect star vehicle for grant , allowing him to finally move away from his usual bumbling , tongue-tied screen persona . 
-1 the premise is overshadowed by the uberviolence of the clericks as this becomes just another kung-fu sci-fi movie with silly action sequences . 
+1 this is a film brimming with detail and nuance and one that speaks volumes about the ability of the human spirit to find solace in events that could easily crush it forever . 
-1 good for a few unintentional laughs , " extreme ops " was obviously made for the " xxx " crowd , people who enjoy mindless action without the benefit of decent acting , writing , and direction . 
-1 does anyone much think the central story of brendan behan is that he was a bisexual sweetheart before he took to drink ? 
-1 teen movies have really hit the skids . 
-1 what a stiflingly unfunny and unoriginal mess this is ! 
+1 a triumph , a film that hews out a world and carries us effortlessly from darkness to light . 
-1 utterly lacking in charm , wit and invention , roberto benigni's pinocchio is an astonishingly bad film . 
+1 ratliff's two previous titles , plutonium circus and purgatory county show his penchant for wry , contentious configurations , and this film is part of that delicate canon . 
-1 the film . . . presents classic moral-condundrum drama : what would you have done to survive ? the problem with the film is whether these ambitions , laudable in themselves , justify a theatrical simulation of the death camp of auschwitz ii-birkenau . 
+1 the performances take the movie to a higher level . 
-1 seemingly disgusted with the lazy material and the finished product's unshapely look , director fisher stevens inexplicably dips key moments from the film in waking life water colors . 
+1 what bubbles up out of john c . walsh's pipe dream is the distinct and very welcome sense of watching intelligent people making a movie they might actually want to watch . 
-1 a visually flashy but narratively opaque and emotionally vapid exercise in style and mystification . 
+1 broomfield is energized by volletta wallace's maternal fury , her fearlessness , and because of that , his film crackles . 
-1 shyamalan should stop trying to please his mom . 
-1 though her fans will assuredly have their funny bones tickled , others will find their humor-seeking dollars best spent elsewhere . 
+1 somehow ms . griffiths and mr . pryce bring off this wild welsh whimsy . 
-1 yet another arnold vehicle that fails to make adequate use of his particular talents . 
-1 a great ensemble cast can't lift this heartfelt enterprise out of the familiar . 
-1 there's nothing provocative about this film save for the ways in which it studiously avoids provoking thought . 
-1 each story is built on a potentially interesting idea , but the first two are ruined by amateurish writing and acting , while the third feels limited by its short running time . 
+1 there's a wickedly subversive bent to the best parts of birthday girl . 
-1 the trashy teen-sleaze equivalent of showgirls . 
-1 eddie murphy and owen wilson have a cute partnership in i spy , but the movie around them is so often nearly nothing that their charm doesn't do a load of good . 
+1 charlotte sometimes is a gem . it's always enthralling . 
+1 cusack's just brilliant in this . 
+1 manages to please its intended audience -- children -- without placing their parents in a coma-like state . 
+1 writer-director burger imaginatively fans the embers of a dormant national grief and curiosity that has calcified into chronic cynicism and fear . 
-1 despite bearing the paramount imprint , it's a bargain-basement european pickup . what's hard to understand is why anybody picked it up . wiser souls would have tactfully pretended not to see it and left it lying there
+1 one of the very best movies ever made about the life of moviemaking . 
-1 flaunts its quirky excesses like a new year's eve drunk sporting a paper party hat . 
-1 involving at times , but lapses quite casually into the absurd . 
+1 the movie worked for me right up to the final scene , and then it caved in . 
+1 the stunning , dreamlike visuals will impress even those viewers who have little patience for euro-film pretension .

+1 creeps you out in high style , even if nakata did it better . 
+1 fans of nijinsky will savor every minute of cox's work . 
-1 opens as promising as any war/adventure film you'll ever see and dissolves into a routine courtroom drama , better suited for a movie titled " glory : a soldier's story . " 
-1 [javier bardem is] one of the few reasons to watch the film , which director gerardo vera has drenched in swoony music and fever-pitched melodrama . 
+1 director of photography benoit delhomme shot the movie in delicious colors , and the costumes and sets are grand . 
+1 not a bad journey at all . 
-1 an awful lot like one of [spears'] music videos in content -- except that it goes on for at least 90 more minutes and , worse , that you have to pay if you want to see it . 
+1 its vision of that awkward age when sex threatens to overwhelm everything else is acute enough to make everyone who has been there squirm with recognition . 
+1 harmless fun . 
+1 watching this film , what we feel isn't mainly suspense or excitement . the dominant feeling is something like nostalgia . 
+1 a solid , psychological action film from hong kong . 
+1 maintains your interest until the end and even leaves you with a few lingering animated thoughts . 
+1 compelling as it is exotic , fast runner has a plot that rivals shakespeare for intrigue , treachery and murder . 
-1 its save-the-planet message clashes with its crass marketing . 
+1 my big fat greek wedding is that rare animal known as 'a perfect family film , ' because it's about family . 
-1 one of those staggeringly well-produced , joylessly extravagant pictures that keep whooshing you from one visual marvel to the next , hastily , emptily . 
+1 a provocative movie about loss , anger , greed , jealousy , sickness and love . 
+1 not as distinctive or even as humorous as its needs to be to stand out , but it has clearly been made with affection and care . 
-1 as if drop dead gorgeous wasn't enough , this equally derisive clunker is fixated on the spectacle of small-town competition . 
-1 mushes the college-friends genre ( the big chill ) together with the contrivances and overwrought emotion of soap operas . 
+1 the creative animation work may not look as fully 'rendered' as pixar's industry standard , but it uses lighting effects and innovative backgrounds to an equally impressive degree . 
+1 a compelling , moving film that respects its audience and its source material . 
-1 it takes a strange kind of laziness to waste the talents of robert forster , anne meara , eugene levy , and reginald veljohnson all in the same movie . 
+1  . . . " bowling for columbine " remains a disquieting and thought-provoking film . . . 
-1 purports to be a hollywood satire but winds up as the kind of film that should be the target of something deeper and more engaging . oh , and more entertaining , too . 
+1 the modern-day royals have nothing on these guys when it comes to scandals . it's only in fairy tales that princesses that are married for political reason live happily ever after . 
+1 never mind whether you buy the stuff about barris being a cia hit man . the kooky yet shadowy vision clooney sustains throughout is daring , inventive and impressive . 
-1 this is a film about the irksome , tiresome nature of complacency that remains utterly satisfied to remain the same throughout . even as the hero of the story rediscovers his passion in life , the mood remains oddly detached . 
-1 i'd be hard pressed to think of a film more cloyingly sappy than evelyn this year . 
+1 campanella's competent direction and his excellent cast overcome the obstacles of a predictable outcome and a screenplay that glosses over rafael's evolution . 
-1 for the most part , the ingredients are there . but an unwillingness to explore beyond the surfaces of her characters prevents nettelbeck's film from coming together . 
-1 like a three-ring circus , there are side stories aplenty -- none of them memorable . 
-1 starts as an intense political and psychological thriller but is sabotaged by ticking time bombs and other hollywood-action cliches . 
+1 the piano teacher is not an easy film . it forces you to watch people doing unpleasant things to each other and themselves , and it maintains a cool distance from its material that is deliberately unsettling . 
+1 a glib but bouncy bit of sixties-style slickness in which the hero might wind up caught but the audience gets pure escapism . 
-1 while the mystery surrounding the nature of the boat's malediction remains intriguing enough to sustain mild interest , the picture refuses to offer much accompanying sustenance in the way of characterization , humor or plain old popcorn fun . 
-1 i loved looking at this movie . i just didn't care as much for the story . 
-1 a science-fiction pastiche so lacking in originality that if you stripped away its inspirations there would be precious little left . 
+1 a muckraking job , the cinematic equivalent of a legal indictment , and a fairly effective one at that . 
+1 the people in jessica are so recognizable and true that , as in real life , we're never sure how things will work out . 
+1 the film sometimes flags . . . but there is enough secondary action to keep things moving along at a brisk , amusing pace . 
-1 possibly not since grumpy old men have i heard a film so solidly connect with one demographic while striking out with another . 
+1 good performances and a realistic , non-exploitive approach make paid in full worth seeing . 
-1 a close-to-solid espionage thriller with the misfortune of being released a few decades too late . 
-1 it doesn't quite work , but there's enough here to make us look forward to the russos' next offering . 
+1 the bourne identity is what summer screen escapism used to be in the decades when it was geared more to grownups . 
+1 probes in a light-hearted way the romantic problems of individuals for whom the yearning for passion spells discontent . 
+1 this fascinating look at israel in ferment feels as immediate as the latest news footage from gaza and , because of its heightened , well-shaped dramas , twice as powerful . 
+1 massoud's story is an epic , but also a tragedy , the record of a tenacious , humane fighter who was also the prisoner ( and ultimately the victim ) of history . 
+1 much of the movie's charm lies in the utter cuteness of stuart and margolo . their computer-animated faces are very expressive . 
+1 a terrific b movie -- in fact , the best in recent memory . 
-1 what's needed so badly but what is virtually absent here is either a saving dark humor or the feel of poetic tragedy . 
+1 funny , somber , absurd , and , finally , achingly sad , bartleby is a fine , understated piece of filmmaking . 
-1 the piano teacher is the sort of movie that discourages american audiences from ever wanting to see another foreign film . 
-1 the story's so preposterous that i didn't believe it for a second , despite the best efforts of everyone involved . 
+1 whatever complaints i might have , i'd take [its] earnest errors and hard-won rewards over the bombastic self-glorification of other feel-good fiascos like antwone fisher or the emperor's club any time . 
-1  . . . too gory to be a comedy and too silly to be an effective horror film . 
-1 my own minority report is that it stinks . 
+1 it's about as convincing as any other arnie musclefest , but has a little too much resonance with real world events and ultimately comes off as insultingly simplistic . 
-1 avary's film never quite emerges from the shadow of ellis' book . 
-1 feels like the grittiest movie that was ever made for the lifetime cable television network . 
-1 as an actress , madonna is one helluva singer . as the mediterranean sparkles , 'swept away' sinks . 
+1 by and large this is mr . kilmer's movie , and it's his strongest performance since the doors . 
+1 tres greek writer and star nia vardalos has crafted here a worldly-wise and very funny script . 
+1 throwing it all away for the fleeting joys of love's brief moment . 
+1 vividly demonstrates that the director of such hollywood blockbusters as patriot games can still turn out a small , personal film with an emotional wallop . 
-1 generic slasher-movie nonsense , but it's not without style . 
-1 'in this poor remake of such a well loved classic , parker exposes the limitations of his skill and the basic flaws in his vision . '
+1 lohman adapts to the changes required of her , but the actress and director peter kosminsky never get the audience to break through the wall her character erects
+1 for devotees of french cinema , safe conduct is so rich with period minutiae it's like dying and going to celluloid heaven . 
-1 so routine , familiar and predictable , it raises the possibility that it wrote itself as a newly automated final draft computer program . 
-1 an amalgam of the fugitive , blade runner , and total recall , only without much energy or tension . 
-1 skillful as he is , mr . shyamalan is undone by his pretensions . 
+1 mr . deeds is sure to give you a lot of laughs in this simple , sweet and romantic comedy . 
-1 'abandon all hope , ye who enter here' . . . you should definitely let dante's gloomy words be your guide . 
-1  . . . plays like a badly edited , 91-minute trailer ( and ) the director can't seem to get a coherent rhythm going . in fact , it doesn't even seem like she tried . 
+1 the mood , look and tone of the film fit the incredible storyline to a t . 
+1 morton is a great actress portraying a complex character , but morvern callar grows less compelling the farther it meanders from its shocking start . 
-1 not only are the film's sopranos gags incredibly dated and unfunny , they also demonstrate how desperate the makers of this 'we're -doing-it-for -the-cash' sequel were . 
-1 when it comes to entertainment , children deserve better than pokemon 4ever . 
-1 the reason we keep seeing the same movie with roughly the same people every year is because so many of us keep going and then , out of embarrassment or stupidity , not warning anyone . 
+1 en sí mismo el rey león es un espectáculo digno de contemplarse en cine , dvd o en su soberbio montaje teatral ; pero el hacerlo en la pantalla imax es una experiencia colosal . 
-1 one of the worst films of 2002 . 
+1 offers a breath of the fresh air of true sophistication . 
+1 if there's a way to effectively teach kids about the dangers of drugs , i think it's in projects like the ( unfortunately r-rated ) paid . 
+1 it's great escapist fun that recreates a place and time that will never happen again . 
+1 a lovely film for the holiday season . 
+1 witty , contemplative , and sublimely beautiful . 
-1 diaz , applegate , blair and posey are suitably kooky which should appeal to women and they strip down often enough to keep men alert , if not amused . 
+1 featuring a dangerously seductive performance from the great daniel auteuil , " sade " covers the same period as kaufmann's " quills " with more unsettlingly realistic results . 
-1 'wouldn't it be nice if all guys got a taste of what it's like on the other side of the bra ? '
-1 too infuriatingly quirky and taken with its own style . 
+1 a subject like this should inspire reaction in its audience ; the pianist does not . 
+1 only an epic documentary could get it all down , and spike lee's jim brown : all american at long last gives its subject a movie worthy of his talents . 
+1 at just over an hour , home movie will leave you wanting more , not to mention leaving you with some laughs and a smile on your face . 
-1 filmmakers have to dig deep to sink this low . fortunately for all involved , this movie is likely to disappear as quickly as an ice cube thrown into a pot of boiling water . 
-1 divertingly ridiculous , headbangingly noisy . 
+1 the transporter is as lively and as fun as it is unapologetically dumb
-1 the weird thing about the santa clause 2 , purportedly a children's movie , is that there is nothing in it to engage children emotionally . 
-1 winds up feeling like lots of other quirky movies that try to score hipness points with young adults . 
+1 the film is an earnest try at beachcombing verismo , but it would be even more indistinct than it is were it not for the striking , quietly vulnerable personality of ms . ambrose . 
+1 if you want to see a train wreck that you can't look away from , then look no further , because here it is . 
-1 the narrator and the other characters try to convince us that acting transfigures esther , but she's never seen speaking on stage ; one feels cheated , and esther seems to remain an unchanged dullard . 
+1 a disoriented but occasionally disarming saga packed with moments out of an alice in wonderland adventure , a stalker thriller , and a condensed season of tv's big brother . 
+1 one of creepiest , scariest movies to come along in a long , long time , easily rivaling blair witch or the others . 
-1 i don't even care that there's no plot in this antonio banderas-lucy liu faceoff . it's still terrible ! 
-1 it's a barely tolerable slog over well-trod ground . 
-1 despite its sincere acting , signs is just another unoriginal run of the mill sci-fi film with a flimsy ending and lots of hype . 
+1 with a cast that includes some of the top actors working in independent film , lovely & amazing involves us because it is so incisive , so bleakly amusing about how we go about our lives . 
+1 fuller would surely have called this gutsy and at times exhilarating movie a great yarn . 
+1 what makes the film special is the refreshingly unhibited enthusiasm that the people , in spite of clearly evident poverty and hardship , bring to their music . 
-1 if kaufman kept cameron diaz a prisoner in a cage with her ape , in his latest , he'd have them mate . 
-1 a very depressing movie of many missed opportunities . 
+1  . . . only bond can save us from the latest eccentric , super-wealthy megalomaniac bent on world domination and destruction . 
-1 considering the harsh locations and demanding stunts , this must have been a difficult shoot , but the movie proves rough going for the audience as well . 
-1 there's not much going on in this movie unless you simply decide to buy into the notion that something inexplicably strange once happened in point pleasant . 
+1 at 78 minutes it just zings along with vibrance and warmth . 
+1 audiences are advised to sit near the back and squint to avoid noticing some truly egregious lip-non-synching , but otherwise the production is suitably elegant . 
-1 it's sweet . . . but just a little bit too precious at the start and a little too familiar at the end . 
+1 the vivid lead performances sustain interest and empathy , but the journey is far more interesting than the final destination . 
-1 a kilted jackson is an unsettling sight , and indicative of his , if you will , out-of-kilter character , who rambles aimlessly through ill-conceived action pieces . 
+1 too damn weird to pass up , and for the blacklight crowd , way cheaper ( and better ) than pink floyd tickets . 
-1 excessive , profane , packed with cartoonish violence and comic-strip characters . 
+1 as an introduction to the man's theories and influence , derrida is all but useless ; as a portrait of the artist as an endlessly inquisitive old man , however , it's invaluable . 
-1 i found myself growing more and more frustrated and detached as vincent became more and more abhorrent . 
+1 if you dig on david mamet's mind tricks . . . rent this movie and enjoy ! 
+1 a surprisingly sweet and gentle comedy . 
-1 a generic family comedy unlikely to be appreciated by anyone outside the under-10 set . 
+1 the film sounds like the stuff of lurid melodrama , but what makes it interesting as a character study is the fact that the story is told from paul's perspective . 
-1 barney throws away the goodwill the first half of his movie generates by orchestrating a finale that is impenetrable and dull . 
-1 a movie in which laughter and self-exploitation merge into jolly soft-porn 'empowerment . '
-1 if damon and affleck attempt another project greenlight , next time out they might try paying less attention to the miniseries and more attention to the film it is about . 
+1 a creepy , intermittently powerful study of a self-destructive man . . . about as unsettling to watch as an exploratory medical procedure or an autopsy . 
+1 it will make you think twice about what might be going on inside each trailer park you drive past -- even if it chiefly inspires you to drive a little faster . 
+1 it's technically sumptuous but also almost wildly alive . 
+1 imperfect ? yes , but also intriguing and honorable , a worthwhile addition to a distinguished film legacy . 
-1 it's possible that something hip and transgressive was being attempted here that stubbornly refused to gel , but the result is more puzzling than unsettling . 
+1 schütte's dramatic snapshot of the artist three days before his death offers an interesting bit of speculation as to the issues brecht faced as his life drew to a close . 
-1 a little less extreme than in the past , with longer exposition sequences between them , and with fewer gags to break the tedium . 
+1 the lively appeal of the last kiss lies in the ease with which it integrates thoughtfulness and pasta-fagioli comedy . 
+1 a bodice-ripper for intellectuals . 
+1 demonstrates a vivid imagination and an impressive style that result in some terrific setpieces . 
-1 chalk it up as the worst kind of hubristic folly . 
+1 captures the raw comic energy of one of our most flamboyant female comics . 
+1 the movie has lots of dancing and fabulous music . there are slow and repetitive parts , but it has just enough spice to keep it interesting . 
-1 parents beware ; this is downright movie penance . 
+1 lovely and amazing is holofcener's deep , uncompromising curtsy to women she knows , and very likely is . when all is said and done , she loves them to pieces -- and so , i trust , will you . 
+1 my wife's plotting is nothing special ; it's the delivery that matters here . 
+1 bennett's dramatization of her personal descent into post-breakup perdition has a morbid appeal that's tough to shake . 
+1 watching this gentle , mesmerizing portrait of a man coming to terms with time , you barely realize your mind is being blown . 
-1 the result is a gaudy bag of stale candy , something from a halloween that died . 
+1 imamura has said that warm water under a red bridge is a poem to the enduring strengths of women . it may also be the best sex comedy about environmental pollution ever made . 
-1 on a certain base level , blue crush delivers what it promises , just not well enough to recommend it . 
+1 director alfonso cuaron gets vivid , convincing performances from a fine cast , and generally keeps things going at a rapid pace , occasionally using an omniscient voice-over narrator in the manner of french new wave films . 
+1  . . . either you're willing to go with this claustrophobic concept or you're not . 
-1 almost nothing else -- raunchy and graphic as it may be in presentation -- is one-sided , outwardly sexist or mean-spirited . and in a sense , that's a liability . 
-1 if swimfan does catch on , it may be because teens are looking for something to make them laugh . 
+1  . . . flat-out amusing , sometimes endearing and often fabulous , with a solid cast , noteworthy characters , delicious dialogue and a wide supply of effective sight gags . 
+1 the work of a filmmaker who has secrets buried at the heart of his story and knows how to take time revealing them . strange occurrences build in the mind of the viewer and take on extreme urgency . 
-1 problem is , we have no idea what in creation is going on . 
-1  . . . this isn't even a movie we can enjoy as mild escapism ; it is one in which fear and frustration are provoked to intolerable levels . 
+1 ao sair do cinema , eu estava feliz e com saudades de um tempo em que , para mim , a existência de papai noel era um fato inquestionável . 
+1 imagine o . henry's <b>the gift of the magi</b> relocated to the scuzzy underbelly of nyc's drug scene . merry friggin' christmas ! 
+1 while not all transitions to adulthood are so fraught , there's much truth and no small amount of poetry in girls can't swim . 
+1 ' . . . both hokey and super-cool , and definitely not in a hurry , so sit back , relax and have a few laughs while the little ones get a fuzzy treat . '
+1 a competent , unpretentious entertainment destined to fill the after-school slot at shopping mall theaters across the country . 
-1  it feels like an after-school special gussied up with some fancy special effects , and watching its rote plot points connect is about as exciting as gazing at an egg timer for 93 minutes . 
+1 it's a great deal of sizzle and very little steak . but what spectacular sizzle it is ! . . . in this incarnation its fizz is infectious . 
-1 rashomon-for-dipsticks tale . 
-1 unfortunately , the picture failed to capture me . i found it slow , drab , and bordering on melodramatic . 
-1 starts as a tart little lemon drop of a movie and ends up as a bitter pill . 
+1 stephen rea , aidan quinn , and alan bates play desmond's legal eagles , and when joined by brosnan , the sight of this grandiloquent quartet lolling in pretty irish settings is a pleasant enough thing , 'tis . 
-1 wait for pay per view or rental but don't dismiss barbershop out of hand . 
-1 there's a little violence and lots of sex in a bid to hold our attention , but it grows monotonous after a while , as do joan and philip's repetitive arguments , schemes and treachery . 
+1 this illuminating documentary transcends our preconceived vision of the holy land and its inhabitants , revealing the human complexities beneath . 
+1 scooby doo is surely everything its fans are hoping it will be , and in that sense is a movie that deserves recommendation . 
-1 one big blustery movie where nothing really happens . when it comes out on video , then it's the perfect cure for insomnia . 
-1 i'm sure there's a teenage boy out there somewhere who's dying for this kind of entertainment . 
-1 oops , she's really done it this time . that chirpy songbird britney spears has popped up with more mindless drivel . 
+1 nair does capture the complexity of a big family and its trials and tribulations . . . 
+1 it seems impossible that an epic four-hour indian musical about a cricket game could be this good , but it is . 
-1 it's hard to like a film about a guy who is utterly unlikeable , and shiner , starring michael caine as an aging british boxing promoter desperate for a taste of fame and fortune , is certainly that . 
+1 notwithstanding my problem with the movie's final half hour , i'm going to recommend secretary , based on the wonderful acting clinic put on by spader and gyllenhaal , and also the unique way shainberg goes about telling what at heart is a sweet little girl-
+1 an intense and effective film about loneliness and the chilly anonymity of the environments where so many of us spend so much of our time . 
-1 very special effects , brilliantly bold colors and heightened reality can't hide the giant achilles' heel in " stuart little 2 " : there's just no story , folks . 
-1 no film could possibly be more contemptuous of the single female population .

-1 de niro and mcdormand give solid performances , but their screen time is sabotaged by the story's inability to create interest .

+1 run , don't walk , to see this barbed and bracing comedy on the big screen . 
+1 while centered on the life experiences of a particular theatrical family , this marvelous documentary touches -- ever so gracefully -- on the entire history of the yiddish theater , both in america and israel .

-1 this is an ungainly movie , ill-fitting , with its elbows sticking out where the knees should be . 
-1 part comedy , part drama , the movie winds up accomplishing neither in full , and leaves us feeling touched and amused by several moments and ideas , but nevertheless dissatisfied with the movie as a whole . 
+1 fulfills the minimum requirement of disney animation . 
-1 the story is predictable , the jokes are typical sandler fare , and the romance with ryder is puzzling .

+1 the bodily function jokes are about what you'd expect , but there are rich veins of funny stuff in this movie . 
+1 nicely combines the enigmatic features of 'memento' with the hallucinatory drug culture of 'requiem for a dream . '

-1 it's really just another silly hollywood action film , one among a multitude of simple-minded , yahoo-ing death shows . 
-1 if the movie succeeds in instilling a wary sense of 'there but for the grace of god , ' it is far too self-conscious to draw you deeply into its world .

+1  . . . creates a visceral sense of its characters' lives and conflicted emotions that carries it far above . . . what could have been a melodramatic , lifetime channel-style anthology . 
+1 a simple tale of an unlikely friendship , but thanks to the gorgeous locales and exceptional lead performances , it has considerable charm .

+1 nothing can detract from the affection of that moral favorite : friends will be friends through thick and thin . 
+1 drawing on an irresistible , languid romanticism , byler reveals the ways in which a sultry evening or a beer-fueled afternoon in the sun can inspire even the most retiring heart to venture forth . 
-1 alas , the black-and-white archival footage of their act showcases pretty mediocre shtick .

+1 world traveler might not go anywhere new , or arrive anyplace special , but it's certainly an honest attempt to get at something . 
-1 both the crime story and the love story are unusual . but they don't fit well together and neither is well told . 
-1 the film is strictly routine . 
-1 it wasn't the subject matter that ultimately defeated the filmit was the unfulfilling , incongruous , " wait a second , did i miss something ? " ending .

+1 a stunning piece of visual poetry that will , hopefully , be remembered as one of the most important stories to be told in australia's film history . 
-1 bad and baffling from the get-go . 
-1 it's the kind of movie you can't quite recommend because it is all windup and not much of a pitch , yet you can't bring yourself to dislike it . 
-1 most of the storylines feel like time fillers between surf shots . the movie isn't horrible , but you can see mediocre cresting on the next wave .

+1 ' . . . a great , participatory spectator sport . '
+1 with a confrontational stance , todd solondz takes aim on political correctness and suburban families .

+1 visually striking and viscerally repellent .

-1 too long , and larded with exposition , this somber cop drama ultimately feels as flat as the scruffy sands of its titular community . 
-1 the cumulative effect of the movie is repulsive and depressing . 
-1 there are more shots of children smiling for the camera than typical documentary footage which hurts the overall impact of the film . it's makes a better travelogue than movie . 
-1 to the civilized mind , a movie like ballistic : ecks vs . sever is more of an ordeal than an amusement . 
+1 this enthralling documentary . . . is at once playful and haunting , an in-depth portrait of an iconoclastic artist who was fundamentally unknowable even to his closest friends . 
+1 with so many bad romances out there , this is the kind of movie that deserves a chance to shine .

-1 will only satisfy those who can't tell the difference between the good , the bad and the ugly . 
+1 may take its sweet time to get wherever it's going , but if you have the patience for it , you won't feel like it's wasted yours . 
+1 implicitly acknowledges and celebrates the glorious chicanery and self-delusion of this most american of businesses , and for that reason it may be the most oddly honest hollywood document of all . 
+1 happily for mr . chin -- though unhappily for his subjects -- the invisible hand of the marketplace wrote a script that no human screenwriter could have hoped to match . 
-1 even in terms of the low-grade cheese standards on which it operates , it never quite makes the grade as tawdry trash . 
+1 swimming is above all about a young woman's face , and by casting an actress whose face projects that woman's doubts and yearnings , it succeeds . 
+1 art-house to the core , read my lips is a genre-curling crime story that revives the free-wheeling noir spirit of old french cinema . 
-1 the movie itself appears to be running on hypertime in reverse as the truly funny bits get further and further apart . 
-1 opera on film is never satisfactory . the art demands live viewing . the innate theatrics that provide its thrills and extreme emotions lose their luster when flattened onscreen . 
-1 the parts are better than the whole ( bizarre , funny , tragic - like love in new york ) . 
+1 for the first time in several years , mr . allen has surpassed himself with the magic he's spun with the hollywood empress of ms . leoni's ellie . 
+1 if mostly martha is mostly unsurprising , it's still a sweet , even delectable diversion . 
-1 the cartoon is about as true to the spirit of the festival of lights as mr . deeds was to that of frank capra . 
-1 perhaps the most annoying thing about who is cletis tout ? is that it's a crime movie made by someone who obviously knows nothing about crime . 
-1 each story on its own could have been expanded and worked into a compelling single feature , but in its current incarnation , storytelling never quite gets over its rather lopsided conception . 
-1 derailed by bad writing and possibly also by some of that extensive post-production reworking to aim the film at young males in the throes of their first full flush of testosterone . 
-1 the movie is essentially a series of fleetingly interesting actors' moments . 
+1 toes the fine line between cheese and earnestness remarkably well ; everything is delivered with such conviction that it's hard not to be carried away . 
-1 the film rehashes several old themes and is capped with pointless extremes -- it's insanely violent and very graphic . 
-1 it gets bogged down by hit-and-miss topical humour before getting to the truly good stuff . 
-1 it's absolutely amazing how first-time director kevin donovan managed to find something new to add to the canon of chan . make chan's action sequences boring . 
-1 no dia em que aceitou dirigir esta continuação , harold ramis deve ter saído da cama com o pé esquerdo . e aqueles que decidiram assistir a este filme também . 
-1 none of this is half as moving as the filmmakers seem to think . 
-1 why , you may ask , why should you buy the movie milk when the tv cow is free ? there's no good answer to that one . 
-1 a chaotic panorama that's too busy flying a lot of metaphoric flags . 
+1  " red dragon " is entertaining . an obvious copy of one of the best films ever made , how could it not be ? but it is entertaining on an inferior level . it is a popcorn film , not a must-own , or even a must-see . 
-1 some of seagal's action pictures are guilty pleasures , but this one is so formulaic that it seems to be on auto-pilot . 
-1 yes , spirited away is a triumph of imagination , but it's also a failure of storytelling . 
+1 <em>ash wednesday</em> is not edward burns' best film , but it is a good and ambitious film . and it marks him as one of the most interesting writer/directors working today . 
+1 expands the limits of what a film can be , taking us into the lives of women to whom we might not give a second look if we passed them on the street . 
-1 storytelling feels slight . 
+1  . . . a weak , manipulative , pencil-thin story that is miraculously able to entertain anyway . 
+1 though it's not very well shot or composed or edited , the score is too insistent and the dialogue is frequently overwrought and crudely literal , the film shatters you in waves . 
-1 this movie is something of an impostor itself , stretching and padding its material in a blur of dead ends and distracting camera work . 
+1 it's a treat  a delightful , witty , improbable romantic comedy with a zippy jazzy score grant and bullock make it look as though they are having so much fun . 
-1 it's basically an overlong episode of tales from the crypt . 
+1 it's truly awful and heartbreaking subject matter , but one whose lessons are well worth revisiting as many times as possible . 
-1 so verbally flatfooted and so emotionally predictable or bland that it plays like the standard made-for-tv movie . 
+1 there's no denying the physically spectacular qualities of the film . . . or the emotional integrity of the performances . 
-1 the film's thoroughly recycled plot and tiresome jokes . . . drag the movie down . 
+1 the movie plays up the cartoon's more obvious strength of snazziness while neglecting its less conspicuous writing strength . 
-1 you can see where big bad love is trying to go , but it never quite gets there . 
+1 simply and eloquently articulates the tangled feelings of particular new yorkers deeply touched by an unprecedented tragedy . 
-1 it's a movie that ends with truckzilla , for cryin' out loud . if that doesn't clue you in that something's horribly wrong , nothing will . 
+1 it's a rare window on an artistic collaboration . 
+1  . . . even if you've never heard of chaplin , you'll still be glued to the screen . 
-1 an incredibly irritating comedy about thoroughly vacuous people . . . manages to embody the worst excesses of nouvelle vague without any of its sense of fun or energy . 
-1 its message has merit and , in the hands of a brutally honest individual like prophet jack , might have made a point or two regarding life . 
+1 a drama of great power , yet some members of the audience will leave the theater believing they have seen a comedy . 
-1 a long-winded , predictable scenario . 
+1 strange and beautiful film . 
+1 those outside show business will enjoy a close look at people they don't really want to know . 
+1 'no es la mejor cinta de la serie , ni la mejor con brosnan a la cabeza , pero de que entretiene ni duda cabe . '
-1 adolescents will be adequately served by the movie's sophomoric blend of shenanigans and slapstick , although the more lascivious-minded might be disappointed in the relative modesty of a movie that sports a 'topless tutorial service . '
+1  . . . hits every cliche we've come to expect , including the assumption that " crazy " people are innocent , childlike and inherently funny . 
+1 attal mixes comedy with a serious exploration of ego and jealousy within a seemingly serene marriage . 
+1 a properly spooky film about the power of spirits to influence us whether we believe in them or not . 
+1 the thing about guys like evans is this : you're never quite sure where self-promotion ends and the truth begins . but as you watch the movie , you're too interested to care . 
-1 there is no entry portal in the rules of attraction , and i spent most of the movie feeling depressed by the shallow , selfish , greedy characters . 
+1 it's a smart , solid , kinetically-charged spy flick worthy of a couple hours of summertime and a bucket of popcorn . nothing overly original , mind you , but solidly entertaining . 
+1 if you're hard up for raunchy college humor , this is your ticket right here . 
+1 every moment crackles with tension , and by the end of the flick , you're on the edge of your seat . 
-1 the problem is that rather than dramatizing this premise , mr . desplechin is content to state it . 
-1 the film doesn't have enough innovation or pizazz to attract teenagers , and it lacks the novel charm that made spy kids a surprising winner with both adults and younger audiences . 
+1 victor rosa is leguizamo's best movie work so far , a subtle and richly internalized performance . 
+1 it arrives with an impeccable pedigree , mongrel pep , and almost indecipherable plot complications . 
+1 leading a double life in an american film only comes to no good , but not here . matters play out realistically if not always fairly . 
-1 there's suspension of disbelief and then there's bad screenwriting . . . this film packs a wallop of the latter . 
-1 a technically well-made suspenser . . . but its abrupt drop in iq points as it races to the finish line proves simply too discouraging to let slide . 
+1 frida isn't that much different from many a hollywood romance . what sets it apart is the vision that taymor , the avant garde director of broadway's the lion king and the film titus , brings . 
-1 the movie obviously seeks to re-create the excitement of such '50s flicks as jules verne's '20 , 000 leagues under the sea' and the george pal version of h . g . wells' 'the time machine . ' but its storytelling prowess and special effects are both listless . 
+1 more concerned with overall feelings , broader ideas , and open-ended questions than concrete story and definitive answers , soderbergh's solaris is a gorgeous and deceptively minimalist cinematic tone poem . 
+1 even bigger and more ambitious than the first installment , spy kids 2 looks as if it were made by a highly gifted 12-year-old instead of a grown man . 
-1 essentially , the film is weak on detail and strong on personality
-1 a loud , witless mess that has none of the charm and little of the intrigue from the tv series . 
+1 more sophisticated and literate than such pictures usually are . . . an amusing little catch . 
-1 too campy to work as straight drama and too violent and sordid to function as comedy , vulgar is , truly and thankfully , a one-of-a-kind work . 
+1 between bursts of automatic gunfire , the story offers a trenchant critique of capitalism . 
+1 blisteringly rude , scarily funny , sorrowfully sympathetic to the damage it surveys , the film has in kieran culkin a pitch-perfect holden . 
-1 static , repetitive , muddy and blurry , hey arnold ! would seem to have a lock on the title of ugliest movie of the year . 
+1 in his latest effort , storytelling , solondz has finally made a movie that isn't just offensive -- it also happens to be good . 
-1 wendigo wants to be a monster movie for the art-house crowd , but it falls into the trap of pretention almost every time . 
+1 it seems grant doesn't need the floppy hair and the self-deprecating stammers after all . 
-1 a tired , unimaginative and derivative variation of that already-shallow genre . 
+1 'what's the russian word for wow ! ? '
-1 some movies were made for the big screen , some for the small screen , and some , like ballistic : ecks vs . sever , were made for the palm screen . 
-1 it's a glorified sitcom , and a long , unfunny one at that . 
-1 it throws quirky characters , odd situations , and off-kilter dialogue at us , all as if to say , " look at this ! this is an interesting movie ! " but the film itself is ultimately quite unengaging . 
+1 if you're willing to have fun with it , you won't feel cheated by the high infidelity of unfaithful . 
+1 a damn fine and a truly distinctive and a deeply pertinent film . 
-1 [nelson's] movie about morally compromised figures leaves viewers feeling compromised , unable to find their way out of the fog and the ashes . 
+1 not since ghostbusters has a film used manhattan's architecture in such a gloriously goofy way . 
+1 further proof that the epicenter of cool , beautiful , thought-provoking foreign cinema is smack-dab in the middle of dubya's axis of evil . 
-1 the plot has a number of holes , and at times it's simply baffling . 
-1 so boring that even its target audience talked all the way through it . 
-1 could the whole plan here have been to produce something that makes fatal attraction look like a classic by comparison ? that's the only sane rationale i can think of for swimfan's existence . 
-1 this pep-talk for faith , hope and charity does little to offend , but if saccharine earnestness were a crime , the film's producers would be in the clink for life . 
-1 a film that will probably please people already fascinated by behan but leave everyone else yawning with admiration . 
-1 one key problem with these ardently christian storylines is that there is never any question of how things will turn out . 
-1 the only way to tolerate this insipid , brutally clueless film might be with a large dose of painkillers . 
+1 it's a film that's destined to win a wide summer audience through word-of-mouth reviews and , not far down the line , to find a place among the studio's animated classics . 
+1 waiting for godard can be fruitful : 'in praise of love' is the director's epitaph for himself . 
+1 not everyone will welcome or accept the trials of henry kissinger as faithful portraiture , but few can argue that the debate it joins is a necessary and timely one . 
+1 first-time writer-director serry shows a remarkable gift for storytelling with this moving , effective little film . 
+1 it uses some of the figures from the real-life story to portray themselves in the film . the result is a powerful , naturally dramatic piece of low-budget filmmaking . 
-1 it's probably not easy to make such a worthless film . . . 
+1 it's hard to imagine anybody ever being " in the mood " to view a movie as harrowing and painful as the grey zone , but it's equally hard to imagine anybody being able to tear their eyes away from the screen once it's started . 
+1 it ultimately stands forth as an important chronicle of the abuses of one of latin america's most oppressive regimes . 
-1 little more than a stylish exercise in revisionism whose point . . . is no doubt true , but serves as a rather thin moral to such a knowing fable . 
+1 salma goes native and she's never been better in this colorful bio-pic of a mexican icon . 
+1 the film's welcome breeziness and some unbelievably hilarious moments -- most portraying the idiocy of the film industry -- make it mostly worth the trip . 
-1 due to some script weaknesses and the casting of the director's brother , the film trails off into inconsequentiality . 
+1 a movie i loved on first sight and , even more important , love in remembrance . 
-1 a selection of scenes in search of a movie . 
+1 there's absolutely no reason why blue crush , a late-summer surfer girl entry , should be as entertaining as it is
+1 some people march to the beat of a different drum , and if you ever wondered what kind of houses those people live in , this documentary takes a look at 5 alternative housing options . 
+1 the most brilliant and brutal uk crime film since jack carter went back to newcastle , the first half of gangster no . 1 drips with style and , at times , blood . 
-1 the film , like jimmy's routines , could use a few good laughs . 
-1 bears is bad . not 'terrible filmmaking' bad , but more like , 'i once had a nightmare like this , and it's now coming true' bad . 
+1 the kind of sense of humor that derives from a workman's grasp of pun and entendre and its attendant need to constantly draw attention to itself . 
+1 this is cool , slick stuff , ready to quench the thirst of an audience that misses the summer blockbusters . 
-1 gets the look and the period trappings right , but it otherwise drowns in a sea of visual and verbal clichés . 
+1 the new insomnia is a surprisingly faithful remake of its chilly predecessor , and when it does elect to head off in its own direction , it employs changes that fit it well rather than ones that were imposed for the sake of commercial sensibilities . 
-1 the metaphors are provocative , but too often , the viewer is left puzzled by the mechanics of the delivery . 
+1 a fine documentary can be distinguished from a mediocre one by the better film's ability to make its subject interesting to those who aren't part of its supposed target audience . judging by those standards , 'scratch' is a pretty decent little documentary . 
-1 as a kind of colorful , dramatized pbs program , frida gets the job done . but , for that , why not watch a documentary ? 
-1 initial strangeness inexorably gives way to rote sentimentality and mystical tenderness becomes narrative expedience . 
+1 a gently funny , sweetly adventurous film that makes you feel genuinely good , that is to say , entirely unconned by false sentiment or sharp , overmanipulative hollywood practices . 
+1 piccoli gives a superb performance full of deep feeling . 
-1 too smart to ignore but a little too smugly superior to like , this could be a movie that ends up slapping its target audience in the face by shooting itself in the foot . 
-1 lacks the visual flair and bouncing bravado that characterizes better hip-hop clips and is content to recycle images and characters that were already tired 10 years ago . 
+1 highly watchable stuff . 
-1 with all the sympathy , empathy and pity fogging up the screen . . . his secret life enters the land of unintentional melodrama and tiresome love triangles . 
-1 sex ironically has little to do with the story , which becomes something about how lame it is to try and evade your responsibilities and that you should never , ever , leave a large dog alone with a toddler . but never mind all that ; the boobs are fantasti
-1 [plays] in broad outline as pandering middle-age buddy-comedy . 
+1 rarely has skin looked as beautiful , desirable , even delectable , as it does in trouble every day . 
+1 here polanski looks back on those places he saw at childhood , and captures them by freeing them from artefact , and by showing them heartbreakingly drably . 
-1  . . . there's a choppy , surface-effect feeling to the whole enterprise . 
+1 while i can't say it's on par with the first one , stuart little 2 is a light , fun cheese puff of a movie . 
+1 a strong script , powerful direction and splendid production design allows us to be transported into the life of wladyslaw szpilman , who is not only a pianist , but a good human being . 
+1 all in all , brown sugar is a satisfying well-made romantic comedy that's both charming and well acted . it will guarantee to have you leaving the theater with a smile on your face . 
-1 the beautiful images and solemn words cannot disguise the slack complacency of [godard's] vision , any more than the gorgeous piano and strings on the soundtrack can drown out the tinny self-righteousness of his voice . 
-1 jackson shamefully strolls through this mess with a smug grin , inexplicably wearing a kilt and carrying a bag of golf clubs over one shoulder . 
+1 while not all that bad of a movie , it's nowhere near as good as the original . 
+1 leigh isn't breaking new ground , but he knows how a daily grind can kill love . 
+1 the salton sea has moments of inspired humour , though every scrap is of the darkest variety . 
-1 fails to convince the audience that these brats will ever be anything more than losers . 
+1 you're not merely watching history , you're engulfed by it . 
+1 terrific as nadia , a russian mail-order bride who comes to america speaking not a word of english , it's kidman who holds the film together with a supremely kittenish performance that gradually accumulates more layers . 
-1 an unbelievably stupid film , though occasionally fun enough to make you forget its absurdity . 
+1 the wild thornberrys movie is pleasant enough and the message of our close ties with animals can certainly not be emphasized enough . 
-1 very stupid and annoying . 
-1 there are moments of real pleasure to be found in sara sugarman's whimsical comedy very annie-mary but not enough to sustain the film . 
+1 [city] reminds us how realistically nuanced a robert de niro performance can be when he is not more lucratively engaged in the shameless self-caricature of 'analyze this' ( 1999 ) and 'analyze that , ' promised ( or threatened ) for later this year . 
-1 one of the worst movies of the year . . . . watching it was painful . 
+1 as a tolerable diversion , the film suffices ; a triumph , however , it is not . 
+1 a must for fans of british cinema , if only because so many titans of the industry are along for the ride . 
+1 go see it and enjoy . 
-1 one can't shake the feeling that crossroads is nothing more than an hour-and-a-half-long commercial for britney's latest album . 
-1 isn't it a bit early in his career for director barry sonnenfeld to do a homage to himself ? and it's a lousy one at that . 
+1 parris' performance is credible and remarkably mature . 
+1 apuestas fuertes para el futuro del director , y apuestas bien fundadas , pues la suerte ya la tiene , y la cinta lo comprueba . . . . 
-1 aaliyah rarely dampens her diva persona enough to spark genuine chemistry with townsend . when she speaks , her creepy egyptian demigod voice is as computer processed and overproduced as it was in her music . 
+1 this movie may not have the highest production values you've ever seen , but it's the work of an artist , one whose view of america , history and the awkwardness of human life is generous and deep . 
+1 when you think you've figured out bielinsky's great game , that's when you're in the most trouble : he's the con , and you're just the mark . 
+1 has an unmistakable , easy joie de vivre . 
-1 enchanted with low-life tragedy and liberally seasoned with emotional outbursts . . . what is sorely missing , however , is the edge of wild , lunatic invention that we associate with cage's best acting . 
+1 as animation increasingly emphasizes the computer and the cool , this is a film that takes a stand in favor of tradition and warmth . 
+1 a lovably old-school hollywood confection . 
+1 witty dialog between realistic characters showing honest emotions . it's touching and tender and proves that even in sorrow you can find humor . like blended shades of lipstick , these components combine into one terrific story with lots of laughs . 
-1 writer/director john mckay ignites some charming chemistry between kate and jed but , when he veers into sodden melodrama , punctuated by violins , it's disastrous and kate's jealous female friends become downright despicable . 
-1 allegiance to chekhov , which director michael cacoyannis displays with somber earnestness in the new adaptation of the cherry orchard , is a particularly vexing handicap . 
+1 serious and thoughtful . 
+1 an uncomfortable experience , but one as brave and challenging as you could possibly expect these days from american cinema . 
-1 a fairly harmless but ultimately lifeless feature-length afterschool special . 
+1 it is refreshingly undogmatic about its characters . 
-1 woefully pretentious . 
+1 it will delight newcomers to the story and those who know it from bygone days . 
-1 green ruins every single scene he's in , and the film , while it's not completely wreaked , is seriously compromised by that . 
-1 you see robert de niro singing - and dancing to - west side story show tunes . choose your reaction : a . ) that sure is funny ! b . ) that sure is pathetic ! 
+1 an entertaining mix of period drama and flat-out farce that should please history fans . 
+1 a few artsy flourishes aside , narc is as gritty as a movie gets these days . 
+1 astonishingly skillful and moving . . . it could become a historically significant work as well as a masterfully made one . 
-1 if festival in cannes nails hard- boiled hollywood argot with a bracingly nasty accuracy , much about the film , including some of its casting , is frustratingly unconvincing . 
-1 unfortunately , kapur modernizes a . e . w . mason's story to suit the sensibilities of a young american , a decision that plucks " the four feathers " bare . 
+1 farrell . . . thankfully manages to outshine the role and successfully plays the foil to willis's world-weary colonel . 
+1 a different movie -- sometimes tedious -- by a director many viewers would like to skip but film buffs should get to know . 
-1 an unholy mess , driven by the pathetic idea that if you shoot something on crummy-looking videotape , it must be labelled 'hip' , 'innovative' and 'realistic' . 
-1 warmed-over hash . 
+1 once folks started hanging out at the barbershop , they never wanted to leave . chances are you won't , either . 
-1 sinks so low in a poorly played game of absurd plot twists , idiotic court maneuvers and stupid characters that even freeman can't save it . 
+1  i admire the closing scenes of the film , which seem to ask whether our civilization offers a cure for vincent's complaint . 
+1 hugely entertaining from start to finish , featuring a fall from grace that still leaves shockwaves , it will gratify anyone who has ever suspected hollywood of being overrun by corrupt and hedonistic weasels . 
-1 at the one-hour mark , herzog simply runs out of ideas and the pace turns positively leaden as the movie sputters to its inevitable tragic conclusion . 
-1 little more than a frothy vanity project . 
-1 the film goes from being an unusual sci-fi character study to a chase flick that detracts from its ending . 
+1 the music makes a nice album , the food is enticing and italy beckons us all . 
+1 it's easy to be cynical about documentaries in which underdogs beat the odds and the human spirit triumphs , but westbrook's foundation and dalrymple's film earn their uplift . 
-1 after the first 10 minutes , which is worth seeing , the movie sinks into an abyss of clichés , depression and bad alternative music . 
-1 don't let your festive spirit go this far . 
+1 there is little question that this is a serious work by an important director who has something new to say about how , in the flip-flop of courtship , we often reel in when we should be playing out . 
+1 so refreshingly incisive is grant that for the first time he'll probably appeal more to guys than to their girlfriends who drag them to this movie for the hugh factor . 
-1 if we're to slap protagonist genevieve leplouff because she's french , do we have that same option to slap her creators because they're clueless and inept ? 
+1 features one of the most affecting depictions of a love affair ever committed to film . 
-1 for all its technical virtuosity , the film is so mired in juvenile and near-xenophobic pedagogy that it's enough to make one pine for the day when godard can no longer handle the rigors of filmmaking . 
-1 [sam's] self-flagellation is more depressing than entertaining . 
-1 with very little to add beyond the dark visions already relayed by superb recent predecessors like swimming with sharks and the player , this latest skewering . . . may put off insiders and outsiders alike . 
+1 it's hard to imagine anyone managing to steal a movie not only from charismatic rising star jake gyllenhaal but also from accomplished oscar winners susan sarandon , dustin hoffman and holly hunter , yet newcomer ellen pompeo pulls off the feat with aplomb . 
+1 tadpole may be one of the most appealing movies ever made about an otherwise appalling , and downright creepy , subject -- a teenage boy in love with his stepmother . 
+1 nohe's documentary about the event is sympathetic without being gullible : he isn't blind to the silliness , but also captures moments of spontaneous creativity and authentic co-operative interaction . 
-1 an awkwardly garish showcase that diverges from anything remotely probing or penetrating . 
+1 a witty , trenchant , wildly unsentimental but flawed look at the ins and outs of modern moviemaking . 
-1 a worthy idea , but the uninspired scripts , acting and direction never rise above the level of an after-school tv special . 
-1 it has its moments of swaggering camaraderie , but more often just feels generic , derivative and done to death . 
+1 a virtual roller-coaster ride of glamour and sleaze . 
-1 it's a thin notion , repetitively stretched out to feature length , awash in self-consciously flashy camera effects , droning house music and flat , flat dialogue . 
-1 the overall feel of the film is pretty cheesy , but there's still a real sense that the star trek tradition has been honored as best it can , given the embarrassing script and weak direction . 
+1 a small movie with a big impact . 
-1 consists of a plot and jokes done too often by people far more talented than ali g
-1 [hell is] looking down at your watch and realizing serving sara isn't even halfway through . 
-1 the whole thing's fairly lame , making it par for the course for disney sequels . 
-1 the movie doesn't think much of its characters , its protagonist , or of us . 
-1 crush could be the worst film a man has made about women since valley of the dolls . 
-1 largely a for-fans artifact . 
-1 writer-director ritchie reduces wertmuller's social mores and politics to tiresome jargon . 
+1 having never been a huge fan of dickens' 800-page novel , it surprised me how much pleasure i had watching mcgrath's version . 
-1 safe conduct , however ambitious and well-intentioned , fails to hit the entertainment bull's-eye . 
-1 this action-thriller/dark comedy is one of the most repellent things to pop up in a cinematic year already littered with celluloid garbage . 
-1 this latest installment of the horror film franchise that is apparently as invulnerable as its trademark villain has arrived for an incongruous summer playoff , demonstrating yet again that the era of the intelligent , well-made b movie is long gone . 
-1 it has more in common with a fireworks display than a movie , which normally is expected to have characters and a storyline . 
+1 if this movie leaves you cool , it also leaves you intriguingly contemplative . 
-1 frenetic but not really funny . 
-1 the central story lacks punch . 
+1 we've seen the hippie-turned-yuppie plot before , but there's an enthusiastic charm in <i ? fire that makes the formula fresh again . 
+1 invincible is a wonderful movie . 
-1 may offend viewers not amused by the sick sense of humor . 
-1 eastwood is an icon of moviemaking , one of the best actors , directors and producers around , responsible for some excellent work . but even a hero can stumble sometimes . 
+1 what distinguishes time of favor from countless other thrillers is its underlying concern with the consequences of words and with the complicated emotions fueling terrorist acts . 
+1 wonder of wonders -- a teen movie with a humanistic message . 
+1 the film's appeal has a lot to do with the casting of juliette binoche as sand , who brings to the role her pale , dark beauty and characteristic warmth . 
-1 the respective charms of sandra bullock and hugh grant have worn threadbare . 
+1 as banal as the telling may be -- and at times , all my loved ones more than flirts with kitsch -- the tale commands attention . 
-1 i saw knockaround guys yesterday , and already the details have faded like photographs from the spanish-american war . . . it's so unmemorable that it turned my ballpoint notes to invisible ink . 
-1 the more kevin costner rests on his pretty-boy laurels , the public is , regrettably , going to have tepid films like dragonfly tossed at them . 
+1 visually captivating . 
+1 godard has never made a more sheerly beautiful film than this unexpectedly moving meditation on love , history , memory , resistance and artistic transcendence . 
-1 if you're not fans of the adventues of steve and terri , you should avoid this like the dreaded king brown snake . personally , i'd rather watch them on the animal planet . 
-1 staggers between flaccid satire and what is supposed to be madcap farce . 
-1 everything in maid in manhattan is exceedingly pleasant , designed not to offend . it goes down easy , leaving virtually no aftertaste . 
-1 like life on the island , the movie grows boring despite the scenery . 
+1 evokes the style and flash of the double-cross that made mamet's " house of games " and last fall's " heist " so much fun . 
+1 the film has a kind of hard , cold effect . 
+1 a party-hearty teen flick that scalds like acid . 
+1 a delightful , if minor , pastry of a movie . 
+1 cho's timing is priceless . 
-1 jacobi , the most fluent of actors , is given relatively dry material from nijinsky's writings to perform , and the visuals , even erotically frank ones , become dullingly repetitive . 
-1 it gets old quickly . watch barbershop again if you're in need of a cube fix--this isn't worth sitting through . 
+1 about as big a crowdpleaser as they possibly come . 
+1 overall , it's a wacky and inspired little film that works effortlessly at delivering genuine , acerbic laughs . 
+1 faithful without being forceful , sad without being shrill , " a walk to remember " succeeds through sincerity . 
+1 its rawness and vitality give it considerable punch . 
+1 an intelligently made ( and beautifully edited ) picture that at the very least has a spark of life to it -- more than you can say for plenty of movies that flow through the hollywood pipeline without a hitch . 
+1  . . . the story , like ravel's bolero , builds to a crescendo that encompasses many more paths than we started with . 
+1 many a parent and their teen ( or preteen ) kid could bond while watching a walk to remember . so could young romantics out on a date . 
+1 another best of the year selection . 
-1 for all the time we spend with these people , we never really get inside of them . 
+1 director andrew niccol . . . demonstrates a wry understanding of the quirks of fame . his healthy sense of satire is light and fun . . . . 
-1 it has all the excitement of eating oatmeal . 
+1 a simmering psychological drama in which the bursts of sudden violence are all the more startling for the slow buildup that has preceded them . 
+1 the most ingenious film comedy since being john malkovich . 
+1 sum " is jack ryan's " do-over . " give credit to everyone from robinson down to the key grip that this bold move works . especially give credit to affleck . 
+1 an engrossing portrait of uncompromising artists trying to create something original against the backdrop of a corporate music industry that only seems to care about the bottom line . 
-1 the great pity is that those responsible didn't cut their losses  and ours  and retitle it the adventures of direct-to-video nash , and send it to its proper home . 
+1 unlike most anime , whose most ardent fans outside japan seem to be introverted young men with fantasy fetishes , metropolis never seems hopelessly juvenile . 
-1 a very average science fiction film . 
+1 red dragon is less baroque and showy than hannibal , and less emotionally affecting than silence . but , like silence , it's a movie that gets under your skin . 
+1 i love the opening scenes of a wintry new york city in 1899 . cinematic poetry showcases the city's old-world charm before machines change nearly everything . 
-1 scotland , pa . is a strangely drab romp . some studio pizazz might have helped . 
+1 a very funny movie . 
-1 it bites hard . 
+1 sharp edges and a deep vein of sadness run through its otherwise comic narrative . 
+1 a budget affair that exposes the generally sad existence of the bedouins while providing a precious twinkle of insight into their lives . 
-1 the heedless impetuousness of youth is on full , irritating display in [this] meandering and pointless french coming-of-age import from writer-director anne-sophie birot . 
+1 an infinitely wittier version of the home alone formula . 
+1 perhaps no picture ever made has more literally showed that the road to hell is paved with good intentions . 
+1 there's much tongue in cheek in the film and there's no doubt the filmmaker is having fun with it all . 
+1 confounding because it solemnly advances a daringly preposterous thesis . acting cannot be acted . 
+1 noyce's film is contemplative and mournfully reflective . 
-1 in this film we at least see a study in contrasts ; the wide range of one actor , and the limited range of a comedian . 
-1 very much a home video , and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all . 
-1 instead of hiding pinocchio from critics , miramax should have hidden it from everyone . 
-1 with its paint fights , motorized scooter chases and dewy-eyed sentiment , it's a pretty listless collection of kid-movie clichés . 
+1 beautifully crafted and cooly unsettling . . . recreates the atmosphere of the crime expertly . 
-1 intended to be a comedy about relationships , this wretched work falls flat in just about every conceivable area . 
+1 fast and funny , an action cartoon that's suspenseful enough for older kids but not too scary for the school-age crowd . 
+1 the most amazing super-sized dosage of goofball stunts any " jackass " fan could want . 
-1 the video work is so grainy and rough , so dependent on being 'naturalistic' rather than carefully lit and set up , that it's exhausting to watch . 
-1 the film's darker moments become smoothed over by an overwhelming need to tender inspirational tidings , especially in the last few cloying moments . 
-1 it should be doing a lot of things , but doesn't . 
-1 how many more times will indie filmmakers subject us to boring , self-important stories of how horrible we are to ourselves and each other ? 
+1 murderous maids pulls no punches in its depiction of the lives of the papin sister and the events that led to their notorious rise to infamy . . . 
+1 without resorting to camp or parody , haynes ( like sirk , but differently ) has transformed the rhetoric of hollywood melodrama into something provocative , rich , and strange . 
-1 a mean-spirited film made by someone who surely read the catcher in the rye but clearly suffers from dyslexia
+1 it's both degrading and strangely liberating to see people working so hard at leading lives of sexy intrigue , only to be revealed by the dispassionate gantz brothers as ordinary , pasty lumpen . 
+1 despite modest aspirations its occasional charms are not to be dismissed . 
-1 if you liked the 1982 film then , you'll still like it now . 
+1 it's a satisfying summer blockbuster and worth a look . 
+1 exhilarating but blatantly biased . 
-1 anemic chronicle of money grubbing new yorkers and their serial loveless hook ups . 
+1 there are a few stabs at absurdist comedy . . . but mostly the humor is of the sweet , gentle and occasionally cloying kind that has become an iranian specialty . 
+1 that rare movie that works on any number of levels -- as a film of magic and whimsy for children , a heartfelt romance for teenagers and a compelling argument about death , both pro and con , for adults . 
+1 a documentary to make the stones weep -- as shameful as it is scary . 
+1 works because , for the most part , it avoids the stupid cliches and formulaic potholes that befall its brethren . 
-1 sometimes there are very , very good reasons for certain movies to be sealed in a jar and left on a remote shelf indefinitely . 
-1 don't expect any subtlety from this latest entry in the increasingly threadbare gross-out comedy cycle . 
-1 the film is surprisingly well-directed by brett ratner , who keeps things moving well -- at least until the problematic third act . 
+1 like the best 60 minutes exposé , the film ( at 80 minutes ) is actually quite entertaining . 
+1 [anderson] uses a hit-or-miss aesthetic that hits often enough to keep the film entertaining even if none of it makes a lick of sense . 
+1 the movie is ingenious fun . see it . 
+1 one of those joyous films that leaps over national boundaries and celebrates universal human nature . 
+1 fathers and sons , and the uneasy bonds between them , rarely have received such a sophisticated and unsentimental treatment on the big screen as they do in this marvelous film . 
+1 the trinity assembly approaches the endeavor with a shocking lack of irony , and george ratliff's documentary , hell house , reflects their earnestness  which makes for a terrifying film . 
-1 every sequel you skip will be two hours gained . consider this review life-affirming . 
-1 any film that doesn't even in passing mention political prisoners , poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss . 
-1  . . . they missed the boat . 
-1 comes off as a long , laborious whine , the bellyaching of a paranoid and unlikable man . 
-1 will no doubt delight plympton's legion of fans ; others may find 80 minutes of these shenanigans exhausting . 
-1 a gorgeous , somnolent show that is splendidly mummified and thoroughly unsurprising . 
+1 until ( the ) superfluous . . . epilogue that leaks suspension of disbelief like a sieve , die another day is as stimulating & heart-rate-raising as any james bond thriller . 
+1 by turns very dark and very funny . 
-1 credibility sinks into a mire of sentiment . 
+1 [stephen] earnhart's film is more about the optimism of a group of people who are struggling to give themselves a better lot in life than the ones they currently have . 
-1 wimps out by going for that pg-13 rating , so the more graphic violence is mostly off-screen and the sexuality is muted . 
+1 this road movie gives you emotional whiplash , and you'll be glad you went along for the ride . 
-1 it's bedeviled by labored writing and slack direction . 
-1 a listless sci-fi comedy in which eddie murphy deploys two guises and elaborate futuristic sets to no particularly memorable effect .

-1 more tiring than anything . 
+1 claude miller airs out a tight plot with an easy pace and a focus on character drama over crime-film complications . 
+1 originality ain't on the menu , but there's never a dull moment in the giant spider invasion comic chiller . 
-1  . . . a boring parade of talking heads and technical gibberish that will do little to advance the linux cause . 
-1 something akin to a japanese alice through the looking glass , except that it seems to take itself far more seriously . 
+1 even the digressions are funny . 
+1 i don't know if frailty will turn bill paxton into an a-list director , but he can rest contentedly with the knowledge that he's made at least one damn fine horror movie . 
+1 for all its brooding quality , ash wednesday is suspenseful and ultimately unpredictable , with a sterling ensemble cast . 
+1 hey , happy ! is many things -- stoner midnight flick , sci-fi deconstruction , gay fantasia -- but above all it's a love story as sanguine as its title . 
+1 this is christmas future for a lot of baby boomers . 
-1 ultimately , in the history of the academy , people may be wondering what all that jazz was about " chicago " in 2002 . zellweger's whiny pouty-lipped poof faced and spindly attempt at playing an ingenue makes her nomination as best actress even more of a an a
-1 'how many more voyages can this limping but dearly-loved franchise survive ? '
-1 like being trapped inside a huge video game , where exciting , inane images keep popping past your head and the same illogical things keep happening over and over again . 
-1 overall , the film misses the brilliance of jelinek's novel by some way . it settles for being merely grim . 
+1 this isn't a narrative film -- i don't know if it's possible to make a narrative film about september 11th , though i'm sure some will try -- but it's as close as anyone has dared to come . 
+1 like the full monty , this is sure to raise audience's spirits and leave them singing long after the credits roll . 
-1 [johnnie to and wai ka fai are] sure to find an enthusiastic audience among american action-adventure buffs , but the film's interests may be too narrow to attract crossover viewers . 
-1 chen films the resolutely downbeat smokers only with every indulgent , indie trick in the book . 
+1 a lyrical metaphor for cultural and personal self-discovery and a picaresque view of a little-remembered world . 
-1  . . . one resurrection too many . 
+1 as lively an account as seinfeld is deadpan . 
-1 it's hard to believe that something so short could be so flabby . 
+1 we want the funk - and this movie's got it . 
-1 the film starts promisingly , but the ending is all too predictable and far too cliched to really work . 
+1 like shrek , spirit's visual imagination reminds you of why animation is such a perfect medium for children , because of the way it allows the mind to enter and accept another world . 
+1 if you're not totally weirded- out by the notion of cinema as community-therapy spectacle , quitting hits home with disorienting force . 
+1 deliriously funny , fast and loose , accessible to the uninitiated , and full of surprises
+1 an idealistic love story that brings out the latent 15-year-old romantic in everyone . 
+1 from a deceptively simple premise , this deeply moving french drama develops a startling story that works both as a detailed personal portrait and as a rather frightening examination of modern times . 
-1 though jones and snipes are enthralling , the movie bogs down in rhetoric and cliché . 
+1 though the film never veers from its comic course , its unintentional parallels might inadvertently evoke memories and emotions which are anything but humorous . 
+1  . . . brian de palma is utterly mad : cinema mad , set-piece mad , style mad . it's a beautiful madness . 
+1 there are laughs aplenty , and , as a bonus , viewers don't have to worry about being subjected to farts , urine , feces , semen , or any of the other foul substances that have overrun modern-day comedies . 
+1 the combination of lightness and strictness in this instance gives italian for beginners an amiable aimlessness that keeps it from seeming predictably formulaic . 
-1 the only thing to fear about " fear dot com " is hitting your head on the theater seat in front of you when you doze off thirty minutes into the film . 
+1 a portrait of hell so shattering it's impossible to shake .

-1  . . . another example of how sandler is losing his touch . 
+1 led by griffin's smartly nuanced performance and enthusiasm , the cast has a lot of fun with the material . 
-1 laggard drama wending its way to an uninspired philosophical epiphany . 
-1 dull , a road-trip movie that's surprisingly short of both adventure and song . 
+1 the film's desire to be liked sometimes undermines the possibility for an exploration of the thornier aspects of the nature/nurture argument in regards to homosexuality . 
-1 far-fetched premise , convoluted plot , and thematic mumbo jumbo about destiny and redemptive love . 
+1 what " empire " lacks in depth it makes up for with its heart . 
+1 the film's real appeal won't be to clooney fans or adventure buffs , but to moviegoers who enjoy thinking about compelling questions with no easy answers . 
-1 from the opening scenes , it's clear that all about the benjamins is a totally formulaic movie . 
-1 gaghan . . . has thrown every suspenseful cliché in the book at this nonsensical story . 
+1 mike white's deft combination of serious subject matter and dark , funny humor make " " the good girl " a film worth watching . 
+1 it gets onto the screen just about as much of the novella as one could reasonably expect , and is engrossing and moving in its own right . 
+1 makmalbaf follows a resolutely realistic path in this uncompromising insight into the harsh existence of the kurdish refugees of iran's borderlands . 
+1 it has a way of seeping into your consciousness , with lingering questions about what the film is really getting at . 
-1 there's a reason the studio didn't offer an advance screening . " the adventures of pluto nash " is a big time stinker . 
+1 it's an example of sophisticated , challenging filmmaking that stands , despite its noticeable lack of emotional heft , in welcome contrast to the indulgent dead-end experimentation of the director's previous full frontal . 
+1 there was time on that second round to see the subtleties of ramsay's portrait of grief . 
+1 with amazing finesse , the film shadows heidi's trip back to vietnam and the city where her mother , mai thi kim , still lives . 
+1 wilco fans will have a great time , and the movie should win the band a few new converts , too . 
+1 the rich performances by friel -- and especially williams , an american actress who becomes fully english -- round out the square edges . 
-1 the movie is a lumbering load of hokum but . . . it's at least watchable . 
+1 what [denis] accomplishes in his chilling , unnerving film is a double portrait of two young women whose lives were as claustrophic , suffocating and chilly as the attics to which they were inevitably consigned . 
-1  " my god , i'm behaving like an idiot ! " yes , you are , ben kingsley . 
+1 could have been crisper and punchier , but it's likely to please audiences who like movies that demand four hankies .

+1 zhuangzhuang creates delicate balance of style , text , and subtext that's so simple and precise that anything discordant would topple the balance , but against all odds , nothing does . 
-1  . . . a fascinating curiosity piece -- fascinating , that is , for about ten minutes . after that it becomes long and tedious like a classroom play in a college history course . 
+1 thoroughly enjoyable . 
-1 whatever satire lucky break was aiming for , it certainly got lost in the " soon-to-be-forgettable " section of the quirky rip-off prison romp pile . it's petty thievery like this that puts flimsy flicks like this behind bars
+1 what's most striking about this largely celebratory film . . . is the sense of isolation that permeates these bastions of individuality in an ikea world . 
+1 a slick , engrossing melodrama . 
+1 not too far below the gloss you can still feel director denis villeneuve's beating heart and the fondness he has for his characters . 
-1 the chateau has one very funny joke and a few other decent ones , but all it amounts to is a mildly funny , sometimes tedious , ultimately insignificant film . 
-1 spectators will indeed sit open-mouthed before the screen , not screaming but yawning . 
-1 no big whoop , nothing new to see , zero thrills , too many flashbacks and a choppy ending make for a bad film . 
-1 a less-than-thrilling thriller . 
+1 a wry , affectionate delight . 
+1 if the real-life story is genuinely inspirational , the movie stirs us as well . 
+1 alain choquart's camera barely stops moving , portraying both the turmoil of the time and giving conduct a perpetual sense of urgency , which , for a film that takes nearly three hours to unspool , is both funny and irritating . 
+1 knows how to make our imagination wonder . 
-1 stinks from start to finish , like a wet burlap sack of gloom . 
-1 roger michell , who did an appealing job directing persuasion and notting hill in england , gets too artsy in his american debut . 
+1 not only are the special effects and narrative flow much improved , and daniel radcliffe more emotionally assertive this time around as harry , but the film conjures the magic of author j . k . rowling's books . 
+1 pacino is brilliant as the sleep-deprived dormer , his increasing weariness as much existential as it is physical . 
-1 a gratingly unfunny groaner littered with zero-dimensional , unlikable characters and hackneyed , threadbare comic setups . 
+1 the movie has no respect for laws , political correctness or common decency , but it displays something more important : respect for its flawed , crazy people . 
-1 as tweedy talks about canning his stockbroker and repairing his pool , you yearn for a few airborne tv sets or nude groupies on the nod to liven things up . 
+1 this film is so different from the apple and so striking that it can only encourage us to see samira makhmalbaf as a very distinctive sensibility , working to develop her own film language with conspicuous success . 
-1 evelyn may be based on a true and historically significant story , but the filmmakers have made every effort to disguise it as an unimaginative screenwriter's invention . 
+1 in a normal screen process , these bromides would be barely enough to sustain an interstitial program on the discovery channel . but in imax 3-d , the clichés disappear into the vertiginous perspectives opened up by the photography . 
+1 nicely serves as an examination of a society in transition .

-1 if you've got a house full of tots -- don't worry , this will be on video long before they grow up and you can wait till then . 
-1 decent but dull . 
-1 you would be better off investing in the worthy emi recording that serves as the soundtrack , or the home video of the 1992 malfitano-domingo production . 
-1 by the miserable standards to which the slasher genre has sunk , . . . actually pretty good . of course , by more objective measurements it's still quite bad . 
+1 contando com uma premissa curiosa , o filme mergulha o espectador em um clima de forte suspense , culminando em um desfecho que certamente fica na memória . 
-1 though there's a clarity of purpose and even-handedness to the film's direction , the drama feels rigged and sluggish . 
+1 the ingenious construction ( adapted by david hare from michael cunningham's novel ) constantly flows forwards and back , weaving themes among three strands which allow us to view events as if through a prism
-1 kurys never shows why , of all the period's volatile romantic lives , sand and musset are worth particular attention . 
-1 [taylor] takes us on a ride that's consistently surprising , easy to watch -- but , oh , so dumb . 
+1 chicago offers much colorful eye candy , including the spectacle of gere in his dancing shoes , hoofing and crooning with the best of them . 
-1  . . . the sum of the parts equals largely a confused mediocrity . 
-1 everything else about high crimes is , like the military system of justice it portrays , tiresomely regimented . 
+1 a remarkable 179-minute meditation on the nature of revolution . 
-1 forget the misleading title , what's with the unexplained baboon cameo ? 
-1 an empty , purposeless exercise . 
+1 offers a guilt-free trip into feel-good territory . 
-1 the umpteenth summer skinny dip in jerry bruckheimer's putrid pond of retread action twaddle . 
-1 an easy watch , except for the annoying demeanour of its lead character . 
-1 flashy , pretentious and as impenetrable as morvern's thick , working-class scottish accent . 
-1 drives for the same kind of bittersweet , conciliatory tone that three seasons achieved but loses its way in rhetorical excess and blatant sentimentality . 
+1 it's consistently funny , in an irresistible junior-high way , and consistently free of any gag that would force you to give it a millisecond of thought . 
+1 if you don't flee , you might be seduced . if you don't laugh , flee . 
-1 fails in making this character understandable , in getting under her skin , in exploring motivation . . . well before the end , the film grows as dull as its characters , about whose fate it is hard to care . 
-1 the world needs more filmmakers with passionate enthusiasms like martin scorsese . but it doesn't need gangs of new york . 
-1 troll the cult section of your local video store for the real deal . 
-1 if only it were , well , funnier . 
-1 the film is really not so much bad as bland . 
-1 the most hopelessly monotonous film of the year , noteworthy only for the gimmick of being filmed as a single unbroken 87-minute take . 
+1  . . . a poignant and powerful narrative that reveals that reading writing and arithmetic are not the only subjects to learn in life . 
+1 psychologically revealing . 
+1 unflinchingly bleak and desperate
-1 just an average comedic dateflick but not a waste of time . 
+1  " home movie " is the film equivalent of a lovingly rendered coffee table book . 
+1 ms . seigner and mr . serrault bring fresh , unforced naturalism to their characters . 
-1 shaky close-ups of turkey-on-rolls , stubbly chins , liver spots , red noses and the filmmakers new bobbed do draw easy chuckles but lead nowhere . 
-1  . . . would be a total loss if not for two supporting performances taking place at the movie's edges . 
-1 in an effort , i suspect , not to offend by appearing either too serious or too lighthearted , it offends by just being wishy-washy . 
+1 damon brings the proper conviction to his role as [jason bourne] . 
-1 it comes off as so silly that you wouldn't be surprised if ba , murdock and rest of the a-team were seen giving chase in a black and red van . 
+1 a muted freak-out
-1 the script kicks in , and mr . hartley's distended pace and foot-dragging rhythms follow . 
+1 although commentary on nachtwey is provided . . . it's the image that really tells the tale . 
-1 a bland animated sequel that hardly seems worth the effort . 
-1 much like its easily dismissive take on the upscale lifestyle , there isn't much there here . 
-1 don't hate el crimen del padre amaro because it's anti-catholic . hate it because it's lousy . 
+1 offers enough playful fun to entertain the preschool set while embracing a wholesome attitude . 
+1 if you ignore the cliches and concentrate on city by the sea's interpersonal drama , it ain't half-bad . 
+1 a wild ride juiced with enough energy and excitement for at least three films . 
+1 romanek keeps the film constantly taut . . . reflecting the character's instability with a metaphorical visual style and an unnerving , heartbeat-like score . 
-1 the movie is a negligible work of manipulation , an exploitation piece doing its usual worst to guilt-trip parents . 
-1 adults will certainly want to spend their time in the theater thinking up grocery lists and ways to tell their kids how not to act like pinocchio . as for children , they won't enjoy the movie at all . 
-1 nair stuffs the film with dancing , henna , ornamentation , and group song , but her narrative clichés and telegraphed episodes smell of old soap opera . 
+1 resourceful and ingenious entertainment . 
-1 without september 11 , collateral damage would have been just another bad movie . now it's a bad , embarrassing movie . 
+1 the film will appeal to discovery channel fans and will surely widen the perspective of those of us who see the continent through rose-colored glasses . 
-1 rob schneider's infantile cross-dressing routines fill the hot chick , the latest gimmick from this unimaginative comedian . 
-1 there are cheesy backdrops , ridiculous action sequences , and many tired jokes about men in heels . 
-1 barry sonnenfeld owes frank the pug big time
+1 a woman's pic directed with resonance by ilya chaiken . 
-1 the film is like sitting in a downtown café , overhearing a bunch of typical late-twenty-somethings natter on about nothing , and desperately wishing you could change tables . 
+1 the members manage to pronounce kok exactly as you think they might , thus giving the cast ample opportunity to use that term as often as possible . it's very beavis and butthead , yet always seems to elicit a chuckle . 
+1 a somewhat crudely constructed but gripping , questing look at a person so racked with self-loathing , he becomes an enemy to his own race . 
-1 what you get with empire is a movie you've seen many times before , repackaged as new material because there is a latino in the lead . 
-1 zigzag might have been richer and more observant if it were less densely plotted . 
-1 a period story about a catholic boy who tries to help a jewish friend get into heaven by sending the audience straight to hell . 
+1 roman polanski's autobiographical gesture at redemption is better than 'shindler's list' - it is more than merely a holocaust movie . 
-1 life is a crock -- or something like it . 
+1 strange , funny , twisted , brilliant and macabre . 
+1 reinforces the often forgotten fact of the world's remarkably varying human population and mindset , and its capacity to heal using creative , natural and ancient antidotes . 
+1 a brutally honest documentary about a much anticipated family reunion that goes wrong thanks to culture shock and a refusal to empathize with others . 
-1 in gleefully , thumpingly hyperbolic terms , it covers just about every cliche in the compendium about crass , jaded movie types and the phony baloney movie biz . 
-1  . . . a ho-hum affair , always watchable yet hardly memorable . 
-1 for close to two hours the audience is forced to endure three terminally depressed , mostly inarticulate , hyper dysfunctional families for the price of one . 
+1  . . . an enjoyably frothy 'date movie' . . . 
+1 stay clear of reminding yourself that it's a " true story " and you're likely to have one helluva time at the movies . 
-1 plays like a bad blend of an overripe episode of tv's dawson's creek and a recycled and dumbed-down version of love story . 
+1 like a poor man's you can count on me
-1 the premise for this kegger comedy probably sounded brilliant four six-packs and a pitcher of margaritas in , but the film must have been written . . . in the thrall of a vicious hangover . 
-1 the jokes are telegraphed so far in advance they must have been lost in the mail . 
+1 an exciting and involving rock music doc , a smart and satisfying look inside that tumultuous world . 
+1 it may be a no-brainer , but at least it's a funny no-brainer . 
+1 smith's point is simple and obvious -- people's homes are extensions of themselves , and particularly eccentric people have particularly eccentric living spaces -- but his subjects are charmers . 
+1 this is a superior horror flick . 
+1 ian holm conquers france as an earthy napoleon
-1 does little more than play an innocuous game of fill-in- the-blanks with a tragic past . 
-1 tries to add some spice to its quirky sentiments but the taste is all too familiar . 
-1 the central character isn't complex enough to hold our interest . 
+1 no sophomore slump for director sam mendes , who segues from oscar winner to oscar-winning potential with a smooth sleight of hand . 
+1 if there's one big point to promises , it's that nothing can change while physical and psychological barriers keep the sides from speaking even one word to each other . 
+1 this charming but slight tale has warmth , wit and interesting characters compassionately portrayed . 
+1 the gorgeously elaborate continuation of " the lord of the rings " trilogy is so huge that a column of words cannot adequately describe co-writer/director peter jackson's expanded vision of j . r . r . tolkien's middle-earth . 
+1 gorgeous scenes , masterful performances , but the sickly sweet gender normative narrative left an acrid test in this gourmet's mouth . 
+1 this familiar rise-and-fall tale is long on glamour and short on larger moralistic consequences , though it's told with sharp ears and eyes for the tenor of the times . 
+1 warm in its loving yet unforgivingly inconsistent depiction of everyday people , relaxed in its perfect quiet pace and proud in its message . i loved this film . 
-1 partly a schmaltzy , by-the-numbers romantic comedy , partly a shallow rumination on the emptiness of success -- and entirely soulless . 
+1 well-acted , well-directed and , for all its moodiness , not too pretentious . 
+1 there's really only one good idea in this movie , but the director runs with it and presents it with an unforgettable visual panache . 
+1  . . . very funny , very enjoyable . . . 
-1 abandons all pretense of creating historical context and waltzes off into a hectic soap about the ups and downs of the heavy breathing between the two artists . 
+1 a solidly constructed , entertaining thriller that stops short of true inspiration . 
-1 i can take infantile humor . . . but this is the sort of infantile that makes you wonder about changing the director and writer's diapers . 
-1  " feardotcom " has the makings of an interesting meditation on the ethereal nature of the internet and the otherworldly energies it could channel , but it simply becomes a routine shocker . 
-1 it should be mentioned that the set design and interiors of the haunted vessel are more than effectively creepy and moodily lit . so i just did . 
-1 ultimately , clarity matters , both in breaking codes and making movies . enigma lacks it . 
-1 everything's serious , poetic , earnest and -- sadly -- dull . 
+1 the most wondrous love story in years , it is a great film . 
+1 what elevates the movie above the run-of-the-mill singles blender is its surreal sense of humor and technological finish . 
-1 deserving of its critical backlash and more . 
-1 shanghai ghetto should be applauded for finding a new angle on a tireless story , but you might want to think twice before booking passage . 
+1 it's tough to watch , but it's a fantastic movie . 
-1 the story is -- forgive me -- a little thin , and the filmmaking clumsy and rushed . 
-1 several uninteresting , unlikeable people do bad things to and with each other in " unfaithful . " why anyone who is not a character in this movie should care is beyond me . 
+1 i would be shocked if there was actually one correct interpretation , but that shouldn't make the movie or the discussion any less enjoyable . 
+1 the philosophical musings of the dialogue jar against the tawdry soap opera antics of the film's action in a way that is surprisingly enjoyable . 
-1 [it's] a prison soccer movie starring charismatic tough guy vinnie jones , but it had too much spitting for me to enjoy . 
+1 as home movie gone haywire , it's pretty enjoyable , but as sexual manifesto , i'd rather listen to old tori amos records . 
-1 a ragbag of cliches . 
+1 a low-key labor of love that strikes a very resonant chord . 
-1 frankly , it's kind of insulting , both to men and women . and it's not that funny -- which is just generally insulting . 
-1 the screenplay is hugely overwritten , with tons and tons of dialogue -- most of it given to children . 
+1 it's sobering , particularly if anyone still thinks this conflict can be resolved easily , or soon . 
+1 a three-hour cinema master class . 
+1 while surprisingly sincere , this average little story is adorned with some awesome action photography and surfing . 
-1 the cartoon that isn't really good enough to be on afternoon tv is now a movie that isn't really good enough to be in theaters . 
+1 there's back-stabbing , inter-racial desire and , most importantly , singing and dancing . 
-1 as a feature-length film , it wears out its welcome as tryingly as the title character . 
+1 an endlessly fascinating , landmark movie that is as bold as anything the cinema has seen in years . 
-1 just a kiss is a just a waste . 
-1 after an hour and a half of wondering -- sometimes amusedly , sometimes impatiently -- just what this strenuously unconventional movie is supposed to be , you discover that the answer is as conventional as can be . 
+1 by no means a slam-dunk and sure to ultimately disappoint the action fans who will be moved to the edge of their seats by the dynamic first act , it still comes off as a touching , transcendent love story . 
-1 a summary of the plot doesn't quite do justice to the awfulness of the movie , for that comes through all too painfully in the execution . 
+1 falls neatly into the category of good stupid fun . 
-1 the movie straddles the fence between escapism and social commentary , and on both sides it falls short . 
-1 a mimetic approximation of better films like contempt and 8 1/2 . 
-1 it's just weirdness for the sake of weirdness , and where human nature should be ingratiating , it's just grating . 
-1 this long and relentlessly saccharine film is a clear case of preaching to the converted . 
-1 a cinematic sleeping pill of impressive potency . 
-1 nothing in waking up in reno ever inspired me to think of its inhabitants as anything more than markers in a screenplay . 
-1 every good actor needs to do his or her own hamlet . for benigni it wasn't shakespeare whom he wanted to define his career with but pinocchio . it might as well have been problem child iv . 
-1 like leafing through an album of photos accompanied by the sketchiest of captions . 
+1 armed with a game supporting cast , from the pitch-perfect forster to the always hilarious meara and levy , like mike shoots and scores , doing its namesake proud . 
-1 it's not a bad premise , just a bad movie . 
-1 execrable . 
-1 not the great american comedy , but if you liked the previous movies in the series , you'll have a good time with this one too . 
+1 a fine production with splendid singing by angela gheorghiu , ruggero raimondi , and roberto alagna . 
+1 it's fun , wispy , wise and surprisingly inoffensive for a film about a teen in love with his stepmom . 
+1 a fresh , entertaining comedy that looks at relationships minus traditional gender roles . 
-1 passion , lip-synching , tragedy , and lots of really really high notes . for me , this opera isn't a favorite , so it's a long time before the fat lady sings . 
+1 a backstage must-see for true fans of comedy . 
+1 the camera soars above the globe in dazzling panoramic shots that make the most of the large-screen format , before swooping down on a string of exotic locales , scooping the whole world up in a joyous communal festival of rhythm . 
-1 no better or worse than 'truth or consequences , n . m . ' or any other interchangeable actioner with imbecilic mafia toolbags botching a routine assignment in a western backwater . 
+1 while this gentle and affecting melodrama will have luvvies in raptures , it's far too slight and introspective to appeal to anything wider than a niche audience . 
+1 gambling and throwing a basketball game for money isn't a new plot -- in fact toback himself used it in black and white . but toback's deranged immediacy makes it seem fresh again . 
+1 you'll end up moved . 
+1 a chilly , brooding but quietly resonant psychological study of domestic tension and unhappiness . 
+1 has enough gun battles and throwaway humor to cover up the yawning chasm where the plot should be . 
+1 both deeply weird and charmingly dear . 
+1 a well paced and satisfying little drama that deserved better than a direct-to-video' release . 
-1 showtime is closer to slowtime . 
+1 the tenderness of the piece is still intact . 
-1  . . . blade ii is still top-heavy with blazing guns , cheatfully filmed martial arts , disintegrating bloodsucker computer effects and jagged camera moves that serve no other purpose than to call attention to themselves . 
+1 the best thing the film does is to show us not only what that mind looks like , but how the creative process itself operates . 
+1  . . . bright , intelligent , and humanly funny film . 
-1 the film's hackneyed message is not helped by the thin characterizations , nonexistent plot and pretentious visual style . 
-1 hypnotically dull , relentlessly downbeat , laughably predictable wail pitched to the cadence of a depressed fifteen-year-old's suicidal poetry . 
+1 with the film's striking ending , one realizes that we have a long way to go before we fully understand all the sexual permutations involved . 
+1 the case is a convincing one , and should give anyone with a conscience reason to pause . 
-1 there is no pleasure in watching a child suffer . just embarrassment and a vague sense of shame . 
+1 a pleasant enough comedy that should have found a summer place . 
-1 you can thank me for this . i saw juwanna mann so you don't have to . 
-1 a plodding teen remake that's so mechanical you can smell the grease on the plot twists . 
-1 the film apparently takes place in a fantasy world where people in hotel hallways recite poetry in voice-over instead of speaking to each other . 
-1 when you resurrect a dead man , hard copy should come a-knocking , no ? 
-1 although it starts off so bad that you feel like running out screaming , it eventually works its way up to merely bad rather than painfully awful . 
+1 i loved the look of this film . 
+1 offers an unusual opportunity to observe the inequities in the death penalty , not just the inherent immorality but also the haphazard administration of it and public misperception of how the whole thing works . 
-1 watching harris ham it up while physically and emotionally disintegrating over the course of the movie has a certain poignancy in light of his recent death , but boyd's film offers little else of consequence . 
+1 almost everyone growing up believes their family must look like " the addams family " to everyone looking in . . . " my big fat greek wedding " comes from the heart . . . 
+1 just as moving , uplifting and funny as ever . 
-1 this is a movie so insecure about its capacity to excite that it churns up not one but two flagrantly fake thunderstorms to underscore the action . 
-1 it's all arty and jazzy and people sit and stare and turn away from one another instead of talking and it's all about the silences and if you're into that , have at it . 
-1 a film with a great premise but only a great premise . 
+1 [howard] so good as leon barlow . . . that he hardly seems to be acting . 
+1 old-fashioned but thoroughly satisfying entertainment . 
+1 great fun both for sports aficionados and for ordinary louts whose idea of exercise is climbing the steps of a stadium-seat megaplex . 
+1 chalk it up to my adoration for both de niro and murphy , but i had a pretty good time with this movie - despite its myriad flaws . 
-1 it is , by conventional standards , a fairly terrible movie . . . but it is also weirdly fascinating , a ready-made eurotrash cult object . it is also , at times , curiously moving . 
+1 the heightened symmetry of this new/old cinema paradiso makes the film a fuller experience , like an old friend haunted by the exigencies of time . 
+1 the chateau is a risky venture that never quite goes where you expect and often surprises you with unexpected comedy . 
-1 i'm guessing the director is a magician . after all , he took three minutes of dialogue , 30 seconds of plot and turned them into a 90-minute movie that feels five hours long . 
-1 a hideous , confusing spectacle , one that may well put the nail in the coffin of any future rice adaptations . 
-1 merely ( and literally ) tosses around sex toys and offers half-hearted paeans to empowerment that are repeatedly undercut by the brutality of the jokes , most at women's expense . 
+1 this in-depth study of important developments of the computer industry should make it required viewing in university computer science departments for years to come . 
+1 i admired this work a lot . 
+1 if you open yourself up to mr . reggio's theory of this imagery as the movie's set . . . it can impart an almost visceral sense of dislocation and change . 
+1 collateral damage finally delivers the goods for schwarzenegger fans . 
+1 murder by numbers' isn't a great movie , but it's a perfectly acceptable widget . 
-1 if you go into the theater expecting a scary , action-packed chiller , you might soon be looking for a sign . an exit sign , that is . 
+1 'si bien no logra desarrollarse como un gran drama , tampoco es tan superficial como muchas cintas que pecan de pretenciosas y que resultan totalmente banales . '
-1 the action here is unusually tame , the characters are too simplistic to maintain interest , and the plot offers few surprises . 
-1 nohe has made a decent 'intro' documentary , but he feels like a spectator and not a participant . 
-1 limps along on a squirm-inducing fish-out-of-water formula that goes nowhere and goes there very , very slowly . 
+1 there's a spontaneity to the chateau , a sense of light-heartedness , that makes it attractive throughout . 
+1 bill morrison's decasia is uncompromising , difficult and unbearably beautiful . 
-1 it's just hard to believe that a life like this can sound so dull . 
+1 a fascinating documentary that provides a rounded and revealing overview of this ancient holistic healing system
+1 remarkably accessible and affecting . 
-1 this movie is so bad , that it's almost worth seeing because it's so bad . 
+1 standing by yourself is haunting . . . [it's] what punk rock music used to be , and what the video medium could use more of : spirit , perception , conviction . 
+1  . . . the plot weaves us into a complex web . 
-1 the movie fails to portray its literarily talented and notorious subject as anything much more than a dirty old man . 
-1 nicolas cage isn't the first actor to lead a group of talented friends astray , and this movie won't create a ruffle in what is already an erratic career . 
-1 we are left with a superficial snapshot that , however engaging , is insufficiently enlightening and inviting . 
-1 succeeds in providing a disquiet world the long-dreaded completion of the police academy series . 
+1 by the end of no such thing the audience , like beatrice , has a watchful affection for the monster . 
-1 sticky sweet sentimentality , clumsy plotting and a rosily myopic view of life in the wwii-era mississippi delta undermine this adaptation . 
-1 love may have been in the air onscreen , but i certainly wasn't feeling any of it . 
+1 murderous maids has a lot going for it , not least the brilliant performances by testud . . . and parmentier . 
+1 it's no surprise that as a director washington demands and receives excellent performances , from himself and from newcomer derek luke . 
+1 there are moments it can be heart-rending in an honest and unaffected ( and gentle ) way . 
+1 it's got all the familiar bruckheimer elements , and schumacher does probably as good a job as anyone at bringing off the hopkins/rock collision of acting styles and onscreen personas . 
-1 squandering his opportunity to make absurdist observations , burns gets caught up in the rush of slapstick thoroughfare . 
+1 the script's snazzy dialogue establishes a realistic atmosphere that involves us in the unfolding crisis , but the lazy plotting ensures that little of our emotional investment pays off . 
+1 byler reveals his characters in a way that intrigues and even fascinates us , and he never reduces the situation to simple melodrama . 
-1 the movie ends with outtakes in which most of the characters forget their lines and just utter 'uhhh , ' which is better than most of the writing in the movie . 
-1 this film is too busy hitting all of its assigned marks to take on any life of its own . 
-1 green might want to hang onto that ski mask , as robbery may be the only way to pay for his next project . 
-1 pumpkin means to be an outrageous dark satire on fraternity life , but its ambitions far exceed the abilities of writer adam larson broder and his co-director , tony r . abrams , in their feature debut . 
-1 by the end , i was looking for something hard with which to bludgeon myself unconscious . 
+1 travels a fascinating arc from hope and euphoria to reality and disillusionment . 
-1 what soured me on the santa clause 2 was that santa bumps up against 21st century reality so hard , it's icky . 
+1 blithely anachronistic and slyly achronological . 
-1 trite , banal , cliched , mostly inoffensive . 
+1 the strength of the film comes not from any cinematic razzle-dazzle but from its recovery of an historical episode that , in the simple telling , proves simultaneously harrowing and uplifting . 
-1 it's been 20 years since 48 hrs . made eddie murphy a movie star and the man hasn't aged a day . but his showboating wise-cracker stock persona sure is getting old . 
-1 there's an excellent 90-minute film here ; unfortunately , it runs for 170 . 
+1 allen shows he can outgag any of those young whippersnappers making moving pictures today . 
+1 wonder , hope and magic can never escape the heart of the boy when the right movie comes along , especially if it begins with the name of star wars
+1 though mama takes a bit too long to find its rhythm and a third-act plot development is somewhat melodramatic , its ribald humor and touching nostalgia are sure to please anyone in search of a jules and jim for the new millennium . 
-1 what is captured during the conceptual process doesn't add up to a sufficient explanation of what the final dance work , the selection , became in its final form . 
-1 more of an intriguing curiosity than a gripping thriller . 
-1 it's as sorry a mess as its director's diabolical debut , mad cows . 
+1 harks back to a time when movies had more to do with imagination than market research . 
+1 like rudy yellow lodge , eyre needs to take a good sweat to clarify his cinematic vision before his next creation and remember the lessons of the trickster spider . 
-1 the subject of swinging still seems ripe for a documentary -- just not this one . 
-1 aimed squarely at the least demanding of demographic groups : very small children who will be delighted simply to spend more time with familiar cartoon characters . 
-1 phoned-in business as usual . 
-1 there's not a fresh idea at the core of this tale . 
-1 leaks treacle from every pore . 
+1 the obnoxious title character provides the drama that gives added clout to this doc . 
+1 like its title character , this nicholas nickleby finds itself in reduced circumstances -- and , also like its hero , it remains brightly optimistic , coming through in the end . 
-1 when the casting call for this movie went out , it must have read 'seeking anyone with acting ambition but no sense of pride or shame . '
+1 if steven soderbergh's 'solaris' is a failure it is a glorious failure . 
+1 the reason to see " sade " lay with the chemistry and complex relationship between the marquis ( auteil ) and emilie ( le besco ) . 
+1 munch's screenplay is tenderly observant of his characters . he watches them as they float within the seas of their personalities . his scenes are short and often unexpected . 
-1 it's better than mid-range steven seagal , but not as sharp as jet li on rollerblades . 
+1 at about 95 minutes , treasure planet maintains a brisk pace as it races through the familiar story . however , it lacks grandeur and that epic quality often associated with stevenson's tale as well as with earlier disney efforts . 
+1 rock solid family fun out of the gates , extremely imaginative through out , but wanes in the middle
-1 the santa clause 2's plot may sound like it was co-written by mattel executives and lobbyists for the tinsel industry . 
+1 strange it is , but delightfully so . 
+1 it's this memory-as-identity obviation that gives secret life its intermittent unease , reaffirming that long-held illusions are indeed reality , and that erasing them recasts the self . 
-1 a loud , low-budget and tired formula film that arrives cloaked in the euphemism 'urban drama . '
-1 makes a joke out of car chases for an hour and then gives us half an hour of car chases . 
+1 an animation landmark as monumental as disney's 1937 breakthrough snow white and the seven dwarfs . 
+1 dog soldiers doesn't transcend genre -- it embraces it , energizes it and takes big bloody chomps out of it . 
-1 where the film falters is in its tone . 
-1 nothing more than a widget cranked out on an assembly line to see if stupid americans will get a kick out of goofy brits with cute accents performing ages-old slapstick and unfunny tricks . 
-1  . . little action , almost no suspense or believable tension , one-dimensional characters up the wazoo and sets that can only be described as sci-fi generic . 
-1 a boring , wincingly cute and nauseatingly politically correct cartoon guaranteed to drive anyone much over age 4 screaming from the theater . 
-1 it takes talent to make a lifeless movie about the most heinous man who ever lived . 
-1 what ultimately makes windtalkers a disappointment is the superficial way it deals with its story . 
+1 washington overcomes the script's flaws and envelops the audience in his character's anguish , anger and frustration . 
+1 you could love safe conduct ( laissez passer ) for being a subtitled french movie that is 170 minutes long . you could hate it for the same reason . 
+1 it's never dull and always looks good . 
+1 a big , gorgeous , sprawling swashbuckler that delivers its diversions in grand , uncomplicated fashion . 
+1 it's crafty , energetic and smart -- the kid is sort of like a fourteen-year old ferris bueller . 
-1 i got a headache watching this meaningless downer . 
+1 last orders nurtures the multi-layers of its characters , allowing us to remember that life's ultimately a gamble and last orders are to be embraced . it's affecting , amusing , sad and reflective . 
-1 not every animated film from disney will become a classic , but forgive me if i've come to expect more from this studio than some 79-minute after-school " cartoon " . 
+1 griffin & co . manage to be spectacularly outrageous . 
+1 stuart's poor-me persona needs a whole bunch of snowball's cynicism to cut through the sugar coating . but once the falcon arrives in the skies above manhattan , the adventure is on red alert . 
+1 a thunderous ride at first , quiet cadences of pure finesse are few and far between ; their shortage dilutes the potency of otherwise respectable action . still , this flick is fun , and host to some truly excellent sequences . 
-1 [serry] wants to blend politics and drama , an admirable ambition . it's too bad that the helping hand he uses to stir his ingredients is also a heavy one . 
+1 there are no special effects , and no hollywood endings . 
-1 flaccid drama and exasperatingly slow journey . 
+1 while dutifully pulling on heartstrings , directors dean deblois and chris sanders valiantly keep punching up the mix . 
-1 the hackneyed story about an affluent damsel in distress who decides to fight her bully of a husband is simply too overdone . 
-1 a cockeyed shot all the way . 
+1 will certainly appeal to asian cult cinema fans and asiaphiles interested to see what all the fuss is about . 
+1 the principals in this cast are all fine , but bishop and stevenson are standouts . 
+1 secretary manages a neat trick , bundling the flowers of perversity , comedy and romance into a strangely tempting bouquet of a movie . 
-1 this isn't a terrible film by any means , but it's also far from being a realized work . 
-1 hollywood has taken quite a nosedive from alfred hitchcock's imaginative flight to shyamalan's self-important summer fluff . 
-1 the plot's contrivances are uncomfortably strained . 
+1 huppert's superbly controlled display of murderous vulnerability ensures that malice has a very human face . 
+1 dazzles with its fully-written characters , its determined stylishness ( which always relates to characters and story ) and johnny dankworth's best soundtrack in years . 
+1 in spite of good housekeeping's unsavory characters and wwf mentality , this white trash war of the roses is a surprisingly engaging film . 
-1 cacoyannis' vision is far less mature , interpreting the play as a call for pity and sympathy for anachronistic phantasms haunting the imagined glory of their own pasts . 
-1 veers uncomfortably close to pro-serb propaganda . 
-1 although purportedly a study in modern alienation , it's really little more than a particularly slanted , gay s/m fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawn-out . 
+1 exudes the fizz of a busby berkeley musical and the visceral excitement of a sports extravaganza . 
-1 however clever nelson has been in providing variation within the confines of her structure and staging , the question remains whether this should , indeed , have been presented as a theatrical release . 
+1 witty , touching and well paced . 
-1 when not wallowing in its characters' frustrations , the movie is busy contriving false , sitcom-worthy solutions to their problems . 
-1 the result is an 'action film' mired in stasis . 
-1 except as an acting exercise or an exceptionally dark joke , you wonder what anyone saw in this film that allowed it to get made . 
-1 nothing sticks , really , except a lingering creepiness one feels from being dragged through a sad , sordid universe of guns , drugs , avarice and damaged dreams . 
-1 bigelow offers some flashy twists and turns that occasionally fortify this turgid fable . but for the most part , the weight of water comes off as a two-way time-switching myopic mystery that stalls in its lackluster gear of emotional blandness . 
+1 there are some wonderfully fresh moments that smooth the moral stiffness with human kindness and hopefulness . 
+1  " it's all about the image . " 
+1 [taymor] utilizes the idea of making kahlo's art a living , breathing part of the movie , often catapulting the artist into her own work . this isn't a new idea . it's been done before but never so vividly or with so much passion . 
-1 they should have called it gutterball . 
-1 'pocas ideas interesantes , un final pseudo místico que no corresponde al tono general del filme y que deja una sensación de inconformidad que hace pensar más de una vez si vale la pena ir a la taquilla y reclamar el precio del boleto . '
-1 mildly amusing . 
-1 it's not difficult to spot the culprit early-on in this predictable thriller . 
-1 worthless , from its pseudo-rock-video opening to the idiocy of its last frames . 
-1 a very long movie , dull in stretches , with entirely too much focus on meal preparation and igloo construction . 
+1 i simply can't recommend it enough . 
-1 sustains its dreamlike glide through a succession of cheesy coincidences and voluptuous cheap effects , not the least of which is rebecca romijn-stamos . 
-1 smug , artificial , ill-constructed and fatally overlong . . . it never finds a consistent tone and lacks bite , degenerating into a pious , preachy soap opera . 
-1 everybody loves a david and goliath story , and this one is told almost entirely from david's point of view . 
+1 berry's saucy , full-bodied performance gives this aging series a much needed kick , making " die another day " one of the most entertaining bonds in years
+1 the power of shanghai ghetto , a documentary by dana janklowicz-mann and amir mann , rests in the voices of men and women , now in their 70s , who lived there in the 1940s . 
+1 rodriguez does a splendid job of racial profiling hollywood style--casting excellent latin actors of all ages--a trend long overdue . 
-1 this thing is virtually unwatchable . 
-1 an ugly , pointless , stupid movie . 
+1 it's definitely an improvement on the first blade , since it doesn't take itself so deadly seriously . 
+1 a subtle and well-crafted ( for the most part ) chiller . 
+1 enormously likable , partly because it is aware of its own grasp of the absurd . 
-1 so we got ten little indians meets friday the 13th by way of clean and sober , filmed on the set of carpenter's the thing and loaded with actors you're most likely to find on the next inevitable incarnation of the love boat . 
-1 a collage of clichés and a dim echo of allusions to other films . 
+1 while this movie , by necessity , lacks fellowship's heart , two towers outdoes its spectacle . 
-1 seeing as the film lacks momentum and its position remains mostly undeterminable , the director's experiment is a successful one . 
-1 astonishing isn't the word -- neither is incompetent , incoherent or just plain crap . indeed , none of these words really gets at the very special type of badness that is deuces wild . 
+1  . . . best seen as speculative history , as much an exploration of the paranoid impulse as a creative sequel to the warren report . 
+1 entertains by providing good , lively company . 
+1  " brown sugar " admirably aspires to be more than another " best man " clone by weaving a theme throughout this funny film . 
+1 those prone to indignation need not apply ; those susceptible to blue hilarity , step right up . 
-1 this is rote drivel aimed at mom and dad's wallet . 
-1 for a film that celebrates radical , nonconformist values , what to do in case of fire ? lazily and glumly settles into a most traditional , reserved kind of filmmaking . 
+1 cho's latest comic set isn't as sharp or as fresh as i'm the one that i want . . . but it's still damn funny stuff . 
+1 the emotions are raw and will strike a nerve with anyone who's ever had family trauma . 
-1 it's actually too sincere -- the crime movie equivalent of a chick flick . 
+1 playing a role of almost bergmanesque intensity . . . bisset is both convincing and radiant . 
+1 an involving true story of a chinese actor who takes up drugs and winds up in an institution--acted mostly by the actual people involved . 
+1 arguably the best script that besson has written in years . 
+1 a very capable nailbiter . 
-1 just how extreme are these ops ? i regret to report that these ops are just not extreme enough . 
+1 one of [jaglom's] better efforts -- a wry and sometime bitter movie about love . 
-1 confusion is one of my least favourite emotions , especially when i have to put up with 146 minutes of it . 
+1 not all of the stories work and the ones that do are thin and scattered , but the film works well enough to make it worth watching . 
-1 although it tries to be much more , it's really just another major league . 
+1 a terrific insider look at the star-making machinery of tinseltown . 
+1 an eerily suspenseful , deeply absorbing piece that works as a treatise on spirituality as well as a solid sci-fi thriller . 
+1 [an] hilarious romantic comedy . 
+1 'it's better to go in knowing full well what's going to happen , but willing to let the earnestness of its execution and skill of its cast take you down a familiar road with a few twists . cynics need not apply . '
+1 who is the audience for cletis tout ? anybody who enjoys quirky , fun , popcorn movies with a touch of silliness and a little bloodshed . 
-1 may reawaken discussion of the kennedy assassination but this fictional film looks made for cable rather than for the big screen . 
+1 a completely spooky piece of business that gets under your skin and , some plot blips aside , stays there for the duration . 
-1 epps has neither the charisma nor the natural affability that has made tucker a star . 
-1 the ill-conceived modern-day ending falls flat where it should deliver a moral punch . 
-1 i'd have to say the star and director are the big problems here . 
+1 if the first men in black was money , the second is small change . but it still jingles in the pocket . it's fun lite . 
-1 an acceptable way to pass a little over an hour with moviegoers ages 8-10 , but it's unlikely to inspire anything more than a visit to mcdonald's , let alone some savvy street activism . 
-1 the worst film of the year . 
+1 the movie is one of the best examples of artful large format filmmaking you are likely to see anytime soon . 
+1 it excels because , unlike so many other hollywood movies of its ilk , it offers hope . 
-1 represents something very close to the nadir of the thriller/horror genre . 
-1 i walked away not really know who " they " were , what " they " looked like . why " they " were here and what " they " wanted and quite honestly , i didn't care . 
-1 just when the movie seems confident enough to handle subtlety , it dives into soapy bathos . 
+1 delivers roughly equal amounts of beautiful movement and inside information . 
-1 'cq may one day be fondly remembered as roman coppola's brief pretentious period before going on to other films that actually tell a story worth caring about
-1 beautifully filmed and well acted . . . but admittedly problematic in its narrative specifics . 
-1 it virtually defines a comedy that's strongly mediocre , with funny bits surfacing every once in a while . 
+1 pacino is the best he's been in years and keener is marvelous . 
-1 yet another genre exercise , gangster no . 1 is as generic as its title . 
+1 this is popcorn movie fun with equal doses of action , cheese , ham and cheek ( as well as a serious debt to the road warrior ) , but it feels like unrealized potential
+1 gently humorous and touching . 
+1  . . . plenty of warmth to go around , with music and laughter and the love of family . 
-1 stupid , infantile , redundant , sloppy , over-the-top , and amateurish . yep , it's " waking up in reno . " go back to sleep . 
+1 the chateau cleverly probes the cross-cultural differences between gauls and yanks . 
+1 one feels the dimming of a certain ambition , but in its place a sweetness , clarity and emotional openness that recalls the classics of early italian neorealism . 
-1 the script boasts some tart tv-insider humor , but the film has not a trace of humanity or empathy . 
-1 freundlich's made [crudup] a suburban architect , and a cipher . 
+1 a beguiling splash of pastel colors and prankish comedy from disney . 
+1 the charm of revolution os is rather the way it introduces you to new , fervently held ideas and fanciful thinkers . 
-1 partway through watching this saccharine , easter-egg-colored concoction , you realize that it is made up of three episodes of a rejected tv show . 
-1 it's a long way from orwell's dark , intelligent warning cry [1984] to the empty stud knockabout of equilibrium , and what once was conviction is now affectation .
