+1 the best film of the year 2002 . 
-1 a fairly by-the-books blend of action and romance with sprinklings of intentional and unintentional comedy . 
-1 the abiding impression , despite the mild hallucinogenic buzz , is of overwhelming waste -- the acres of haute couture can't quite conceal that there's nothing resembling a spine here . 
+1 narc may not get an 'a' for originality , but it wears its b-movie heritage like a badge of honor . 
-1 the movie's heavy-handed screenplay navigates a fast fade into pomposity and pretentiousness . 
-1 contains the humor , characterization , poignancy , and intelligence of a bad sitcom . 
-1 you'll have more fun setting fire to yourself in the parking lot . you'll be more entertained getting hit by a bus . 
+1 a different kind of love story - one that is dark , disturbing , painful to watch , yet compelling . 
+1 if not a home run , then at least a solid base hit . 
+1 auto focus is not your standard hollywood bio-pic . schrader aims to present an unflinching look at one man's downfall , brought about by his lack of self-awareness . 
+1 morton deserves an oscar nomination . 
-1 horrid little propaganda film with fascinating connections not only to the serbs themselves but also to a network of american right-wing extremists . 
+1 like smoke signals , the film is also imbued with strong themes of familial ties and spirituality that are powerful and moving without stooping to base melodrama
+1 it's a glorious groove that leaves you wanting more . 
-1 sadly , hewitt's forte is leaning forward while wearing low-cut gowns , not making snappy comebacks . 
-1 the most opaque , self-indulgent and just plain goofy an excuse for a movie as you can imagine . 
-1 sinks into the usual cafeteria goulash of fart jokes , masturbation jokes , and racist japanese jokes . 
+1 elegant and eloquent [meditation] on death and that most elusive of passions , love . 
+1 it's often infuriatingly glib and posturing , and yet it has been made with great evident care and manages to deliver up the man in a way to arouse further curiosity in even the most unknowing viewer . 
-1 the maudlin way its story unfolds suggests a director fighting against the urge to sensationalize his material . 
+1 it's dark but has wonderfully funny moments ; you care about the characters ; and the action and special effects are first-rate . 
+1 there is a refreshing absence of cynicism in stuart little 2--quite a rarity , even in the family film market . eventually , it wins you over . 
-1 far more enjoyable than its predecessor . 
-1 so-so entertainment . 
-1 less about shakespeare than the spawn of fools who saw quentin tarantino's handful of raucous gangster films and branched out into their own pseudo-witty copycat interpretations . 
+1 one of the most original american productions this year , you'll find yourself remembering this refreshing visit to a sunshine state . 
-1 occasionally interesting but essentially unpersuasive , a footnote to a still evolving story . 
-1 reeboir varies between a sweet smile and an angry bark , while said attempts to wear down possible pupils through repetition . it has no affect on the kurds , but it wore me down . 
-1 terminally brain dead production . 
-1 has nothing good to speak about other than the fact that it is relatively short , tries its best to hide the fact that seagal's overweight and out of shape . 
+1 a winning piece of work filled with love for the movies of the 1960s . 
-1 the whole thing feels like a ruse , a tactic to cover up the fact that the picture is constructed around a core of flimsy -- or , worse yet , nonexistent -- ideas . 
+1 directors brett morgen and nanette burstein have put together a bold biographical fantasia . 
+1 though in some ways similar to catherine breillat's fat girl , rain is the far superior film . 
+1 it is the sheer , selfish , wound-licking , bar-scrapping doggedness of leon's struggle to face and transmute his demons that makes the movie a spirited and touching occasion , despite its patchy construction . 
-1 it's not only dull because we've seen [eddie] murphy do the genial-rogue shtick to death , but because the plot is equally hackneyed . 
-1 there's a lot of good material here , but there's also a lot of redundancy and unsuccessful crudeness accompanying it . 
+1 performances are potent , and the women's stories are ably intercut and involving . 
+1 you can fire a torpedo through some of clancy's holes , and the scripters don't deserve any oscars . but the nerve-raked acting , the crackle of lines , the impressive stagings of hardware , make for some robust and scary entertainment . 
-1 would've been nice if the screenwriters had trusted audiences to understand a complex story , and left off the film's predictable denouement . then nadia's birthday might not have been such a bad day after all . 
+1 the aaa of action , xxx is a blast of adrenalin , rated eee for excitement . and vin diesel is the man . 
-1 a sour attempt at making a farrelly brothers-style , down-and-dirty laugher for the female set . 
+1 parts seem like they were lifted from terry gilliam's subconscious , pressed through kafka's meat grinder and into buñuel's casings
+1 an engrossing and infectiously enthusiastic documentary . 
-1 for every articulate player , such as skateboarder tony hawk or bmx rider mat hoffman , are about a half dozen young turks angling to see how many times they can work the words " radical " or " suck " into a sentence . 
-1 a sensual performance from abbass buoys the flimsy story , but her inner journey is largely unexplored and we're left wondering about this exotic-looking woman whose emotional depths are only hinted at . 
-1 [t]hose same extremes prevent us from taking its message seriously , and the stepford wives mentality doesn't work in a modern context . 
-1 a sha-na-na sketch punctuated with graphic violence . 
-1 [newton]wanders through charlie completely unaware she needs to show some presence and star quality . 
+1 hoffman notches in the nuances of pain , but his smart , edgy voice and waddling profile ( emphasized here ) accent the humor of wilson's plight , and that saves his pathos from drippiness . 
+1 at a time when commercialism has squeezed the life out of whatever idealism american moviemaking ever had , godfrey reggio's career shines like a lonely beacon . 
+1 another entertaining romp from robert rodriguez . 
+1 the gags that fly at such a furiously funny pace that the only rip off that we were aware of was the one we felt when the movie ended so damned soon . 
-1 despite all the closed-door hanky-panky , the film is essentially juiceless . 
+1 talk to her is not the perfect movie many have made it out to be , but it's still quite worth seeing . 
-1 there's a whole heap of nothing at the core of this slight coming-of-age/coming-out tale . 
+1 kwan is a master of shadow , quietude , and room noise , and lan yu is a disarmingly lived-in movie . 
-1 punitively affirmational parable . 
+1 boisterous , heartfelt comedy . 
+1 as a girl-meets-girl romantic comedy , kissing jessica steinis quirky , charming and often hilarious . yet it's not quite the genre-busting film it's been hyped to be because it plays everything too safe . 
-1 for anyone who grew up on disney's 1950 treasure island , or remembers the 1934 victor fleming classic , this one feels like an impostor . 
+1 smith profiles five extraordinary american homes , and because the owners seem fully aware of the uses and abuses of fame , it's a pleasure to enjoy their eccentricities . 
-1 does what should seem impossible : it makes serial killer jeffrey dahmer boring . 
+1 mike leigh populates his movie with a wonderful ensemble cast of characters that bring the routine day to day struggles of the working class to life
-1 do not see this film . 
+1 you may leave the theater with more questions than answers , but darned if your toes won't still be tapping . 
-1 gooding and coburn are both oscar winners , a fact which , as you watch them clumsily mugging their way through snow dogs , seems inconceivable . 
+1 deserves a place of honor next to nanook as a landmark in film history . 
-1 comes . . . uncomfortably close to coasting in the treads of the bicycle thief . 
-1 an odd , haphazard , and inconsequential romantic comedy . 
-1 all very stylish and beautifully photographed , but far more trouble than it's worth , with fantasy mixing with reality and actors playing more than one role just to add to the confusion . 
+1 great character interaction . 
-1 the balkans provide the obstacle course for the love of a good woman . 
+1 there's none of the happily-ever -after spangle of monsoon wedding in late marriage -- and that's part of what makes dover kosashvili's outstanding feature debut so potent . 
-1 impostor can't think of a thing to do with these characters except have them run through dark tunnels , fight off various anonymous attackers , and evade elaborate surveillance technologies . 
+1 meticulously uncovers a trail of outrageous force and craven concealment . 
-1 given too much time to consider the looseness of the piece , the picture begins to resemble the shapeless , grasping actors' workshop that it is . 
-1 even on its own ludicrous terms , the sum of all fears generates little narrative momentum , and invites unflattering comparisons to other installments in the ryan series . 
+1 it's a lovely , sad dance highlighted by kwan's unique directing style . 
+1 a wildly funny prison caper . 
-1 a loud , ugly , irritating movie without any of its satirical salvos hitting a discernible target . 
-1 watching the powerpuff girls movie , my mind kept returning to one anecdote for comparison : the cartoon in japan that gave people seizures . 
-1 couldn't someone take rob schneider and have him switch bodies with a funny person ? 
+1 while obviously aimed at kids , the country bears . . . should keep parents amused with its low groan-to-guffaw ratio . 
-1 a wannabe comedy of manners about a brainy prep-school kid with a mrs . robinson complex founders on its own preciousness -- and squanders its beautiful women . 
+1 it is far from the worst , thanks to the topical issues it raises , the performances of stewart and hardy , and that essential feature -- a decent full-on space battle . 
-1 it's just not very smart . 
+1 [a] superbly controlled , passionate adaptation of graham greene's 1955 novel . 
-1 it's not so much a movie as a joint promotion for the national basketball association and teenaged rap and adolescent poster-boy lil' bow wow . 
-1 a little too pat for its own good . 
-1 entertaining enough , but nothing new
+1 with the prospect of films like kangaroo jack about to burst across america's winter movie screens it's a pleasure to have a film like the hours as an alternative . 
+1 formuliac , but fun . 
-1 a lot like the imaginary sport it projects onto the screen -- loud , violent and mindless . 
-1 like the tuck family themselves , this movie just goes on and on and on and on
+1 the film is a masterpiece of nuance and characterization , marred only by an inexplicable , utterly distracting blunder at the very end . 
-1 as with too many studio pics , plot mechanics get in the way of what should be the lighter-than-air adventure . 
-1 a dark , dull thriller with a parting shot that misfires . 
+1 trades run-of-the-mill revulsion for extreme unease . 
-1 plays like one of those conversations that comic book guy on " the simpsons " has . 
+1 it seems like i have been waiting my whole life for this movie and now i can't wait for the sequel . 
+1 this is a fascinating film because there is no clear-cut hero and no all-out villain . 
+1 [jeff's] gorgeous , fluid compositions , underlined by neil finn and edmund mcwilliams's melancholy music , are charged with metaphor , but rarely easy , obvious or self-indulgent . 
+1 a creaky staircase gothic . 
+1 a delightful coming-of-age story . 
-1 feels less like a cousin to blade runner than like a bottom-feeder sequel in the escape from new york series . 
+1 a slight but sweet film . 
+1 the entire cast is extraordinarily good . 
+1 underachieves only in not taking the shakespeare parallels quite far enough . 
-1 eastwood winces , clutches his chest and gasps for breath . it's a spectacular performance - ahem , we hope it's only acting . 
+1 it's quite diverting nonsense . 
-1 a mostly tired retread of several other mob tales . 
+1 baran is shockingly devoid of your typical majid majidi shoe-loving , crippled children . 
+1 this warm and gentle romantic comedy has enough interesting characters to fill several movies , and its ample charms should win over the most hard-hearted cynics . 
-1 watching it is rather like viewing a long soap opera in which only the first episode was any good . 
+1 tsai has a well-deserved reputation as one of the cinema world's great visual stylists , and in this film , every shot enhances the excellent performances . 
+1 dark and unrepentant , this excursion into the epicenter of percolating mental instability is not easily dismissed or forgotten . 
+1 very solid , very watchable first feature for director peter sheridan
+1 the powder blues and sun-splashed whites of tunis make an alluring backdrop for this sensuous and spirited tale of a prim widow who finds an unlikely release in belly-dancing clubs . 
-1 lacks dramatic punch and depth . 
-1 a reasonably efficient mechanism , but it offers few surprises and finds its stars slumming in territory they should have avoided . 
-1 what we have here isn't a disaster , exactly , but a very handsomely produced let-down . 
+1 what it lacks in originality it makes up for in effective if cheap moments of fright and dread .

+1 a thriller made from a completist's checklist rather than with a cultist's passion . 
-1 the movie's biggest offense is its complete and utter lack of tension . 
-1 no amount of good intentions is able to overcome the triviality of the story . 
+1 what's not to like about a movie with a 'children's' song that includes the line 'my stepdad's not mean , he's just adjusting' ? 
-1 [t]he film is never sure to make a clear point  even if it seeks to rely on an ambiguous presentation . 
+1 a gentle and engrossing character study . 
-1 disjointed parody . 
-1 cold and scattered , minority report commands interest almost solely as an exercise in gorgeous visuals . that's not vintage spielberg and that , finally , is minimally satisfying . 
-1 black-and-white and unrealistic . 
-1 the characters are never more than sketches . . . which leaves any true emotional connection or identification frustratingly out of reach . 
-1 there's no doubting that this is a highly ambitious and personal project for egoyan , but it's also one that , next to his best work , feels clumsy and convoluted . 
+1 bogdanovich taps deep into the hearst mystique , entertainingly reenacting a historic scandal . 
+1 this surreal gilliam-esque film is also a troubling interpretation of ecclesiastes . a rewarding work of art for only the most patient and challenge-hungry moviegoers . 
+1 feardotcom's thrills are all cheap , but they mostly work . 
+1 the ending does leave you unfulfilled , but these are performances to enjoy in a memorable ensemble piece . 
+1 the whole cast looks to be having so much fun with the slapstick antics and silly street patois , tossing around obscure expressions like bellini and mullinski , that the compact 86 minutes breezes by . 
+1 anchored by friel and williams's exceptional performances , the film's power lies in its complexity . nothing is black and white . 
+1 together writer-director danny verete's three tales comprise a powerful and reasonably fulfilling gestalt . 
+1 without heavy-handedness , dong provides perspective with his intelligent grasp of human foibles and contradictions . 
-1 the actors are forced to grapple with hazy motivations that never come into focus . 
-1 it recycles every cliché about gays in what is essentially an extended soap opera . 
-1 instead of using george and lucy's most obvious differences to ignite sparks , lawrence desperately looks elsewhere , seizing on george's haplessness and lucy's personality tics . 
+1 you don't need to be a hip-hop fan to appreciate scratch , and that's the mark of a documentary that works . 
+1 [woo's] most resonant film since the killer . 
+1 greene delivers a typically solid performance in a role that is a bit of a departure from the noble characters he has played in the past , and he is matched by schweig , who carries the film on his broad , handsome shoulders . 
+1 an enchanting spectacular for potter fans anxious to ride the hogwarts express toward a new year of magic and mischief . 
+1 at its best , which occurs often , michael moore's bowling for columbine rekindles the muckraking , soul-searching spirit of the 'are we a sick society ? ' journalism of the 1960s . 
+1 davis has filled out his cast with appealing fresh faces . 
+1 director todd solondz has made a movie about critical reaction to his two previous movies , and about his responsibility to the characters that he creates . 
+1 it's a very valuable film . . . 
+1 baran isn't the most transporting or gripping film from iran -- or , indeed , by its director -- but it's a worthy companion to the many fine , focused films emerging from that most surprising of nations . 
+1 there's a disreputable air about the whole thing , and that's what makes it irresistible . 
+1 a funny and touching film that is gorgeously acted by a british cast to rival gosford park's . 
+1 a rather brilliant little cult item : a pastiche of children's entertainment , superhero comics , and japanese animation . 
+1 maggie smith as the ya-ya member with the o2-tank will absolutely crack you up with her crass , then gasp for gas , verbal deportment . 
-1 consider the film a celluloid litmus test for the intellectual and emotional pedigree of your date and a giant step backward for a director i admire . 
+1 the main story . . . is compelling enough , but it's difficult to shrug off the annoyance of that chatty fish . 
-1 let's face it -- there aren't many reasons anyone would want to see crossroads if they're not big fans of teen pop kitten britney spears . 
-1 amazingly lame . 
-1 although based on a real-life person , john , in the movie , is a rather dull person to be stuck with for two hours . 
+1  . . . the tale of her passionate , tumultuous affair with musset unfolds as sand's masculine persona , with its love of life and beauty , takes form . 
+1 a pleasant romantic comedy . 
+1 quitting offers piercing domestic drama with spikes of sly humor . 
+1 sex is one of those films that aims to confuse . 
+1 coppola's directorial debut is an incredibly layered and stylistic film that , despite a fairly slow paced , almost humdrum approach to character development , still manages at least a decent attempt at meaningful cinema . 
+1 a thoughtful movie , a movie that is concerned with souls and risk and schemes and the consequences of one's actions . 
+1 like dickens with his passages , mcgrath crafts quite moving scenes throughout his resolutely dramatic variation on the novel . 
-1 this loud and thoroughly obnoxious comedy about a pair of squabbling working-class spouses is a deeply unpleasant experience . 
-1 while van wilder may not be the worst national lampoon film , it's far from being this generation's animal house . 
-1 more a gunfest than a rock concert . 
+1 the premise of jason x is silly but strangely believable .

-1 julia is played with exasperating blandness by laura regan . 
+1 the movie should be credited with remembering his victims .

-1 nasty , ugly , pointless and depressing , even if you hate clowns . 
+1 it will grip even viewers who aren't interested in rap , as it cuts to the heart of american society in an unnerving way . 
+1 jeffrey tambor's performance as the intelligent jazz-playing exterminator is oscar-worthy . 
-1 muddled , melodramatic paranormal romance is an all-time low for kevin costner . 
-1 director chris eyre is going through the paces again with his usual high melodramatic style of filmmaking . 
-1 its audacious ambitions sabotaged by pomposity , steven soderbergh's space opera emerges as a numbingly dull experience . 
+1 whether you're moved and love it , or bored or frustrated by the film , you'll still feel something . 
+1 ferrara's strongest and most touching movie of recent years . 
+1 benefits from a strong performance from zhao , but it's dong jie's face you remember at the end . 
-1 the film was produced by jerry bruckheimer and directed by joel schumacher , and reflects the worst of their shallow styles : wildly overproduced , inadequately motivated every step of the way and demographically targeted to please every one ( and no one ) . 
-1 the film's maudlin focus on the young woman's infirmity and her naive dreams play like the worst kind of hollywood heart-string plucking . 
+1 a psychologically rich and suspenseful moral thriller with a stellar performance by al pacino . 
-1 though perry and hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed , haphazard script by jay scherick and david ronn , neither the actors nor director reginald hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining . 
+1 the story feels more like a serious read , filled with heavy doses of always enticing sayles dialogue . 
-1 too lazy to take advantage of its semi-humorous premise . 
+1 tadpole is a sophisticated , funny and good-natured treat , slight but a pleasure . 
-1  . . . a hollow joke told by a cinematic gymnast having too much fun embellishing the misanthropic tale to actually engage it . 
-1 an unintentional parody of every teen movie made in the last five years . 
-1 a banal , virulently unpleasant excuse for a romantic comedy . 
+1 it's funny , touching , dramatically forceful , and beautifully shot . 
+1 it's about issues most adults have to face in marriage and i think that's what i liked about it -- the real issues tucked between the silly and crude storyline . 
+1 if your senses haven't been dulled by slasher films and gorefests , if you're a connoisseur of psychological horror , this is your ticket . 
+1 deepa mehta provides an accessible introduction as well as some intelligent observations on the success of bollywood in the western world . 
+1 land , people and narrative flow together in a stark portrait of motherhood deferred and desire explored . 
-1 a didactic and dull documentary glorifying software anarchy . 
+1 the charms of the lead performances allow us to forget most of the film's problems . 
+1 hashiguchi covers this territory with wit and originality , suggesting that with his fourth feature -- the first to be released in the u . s . -- a major director is emerging in world cinema . 
+1 beautiful , angry and sad , with a curious sick poetry , as if the marquis de sade had gone in for pastel landscapes . 
-1 it showcases carvey's talent for voices , but not nearly enough and not without taxing every drop of one's patience to get to the good stuff .

-1 the entire movie is so formulaic and forgettable that it's hardly over before it begins to fade from memory . 
+1 it somehow managed to make its way past my crappola radar and find a small place in my heart
-1 confirms the nagging suspicion that ethan hawke would be even worse behind the camera than he is in front of it . 
+1 a worthwhile way to spend two hours . 
-1 this one is a few bits funnier than malle's dud , if only because the cast is so engagingly messing around like slob city reductions of damon runyon crooks . 
-1 trying to figure out the rules of the country bear universe -- when are bears bears and when are they like humans , only hairier -- would tax einstein's brain . 
-1 a non-britney person might survive a screening with little harm done , except maybe for the last 15 minutes , which are as maudlin as any after-school special you can imagine . 
+1 hayek is stunning as frida and . . . a star-making project . 
+1 eight crazy nights is a showcase for sandler's many talents .

-1 bluto blutarsky , we miss you . 
+1 moore provides an invaluable service by sparking debate and encouraging thought . better still , he does all of this , and more , while remaining one of the most savagely hilarious social critics this side of jonathan swift . 
+1 claude chabrol has here a thriller without thrills , but that's okay . 
+1 a true pleasure . 
+1 the stars may be college kids , but the subject matter is as adult as you can get : the temptations of the flesh are unleashed by a slightly crazed , overtly determined young woman and a one-night swim turns into an ocean of trouble . 
+1 some movies blend together as they become distant memories . mention " solaris " five years from now and i'm sure those who saw it will have an opinion to share . 
-1 a tired , predictable , bordering on offensive , waste of time , money and celluloid .

+1 hard to resist .

-1 a painfully slow cliche-ridden film filled with more holes than clyde barrow's car . 
+1 that the real antwone fisher was able to overcome his personal obstacles and become a good man is a wonderful thing ; that he has been able to share his story so compellingly with us is a minor miracle . 
+1 exciting and direct , with ghost imagery that shows just enough to keep us on our toes .

-1 a big , baggy , sprawling carnival of a movie , stretching out before us with little rhyme or reason .

-1 marinated in clichés and mawkish dialogue . 
-1 a well acted and well intentioned snoozer . 
+1 a stunning and overwhelmingly cogent case for kissinger as a calculating war criminal . 
+1 [leigh] has a true talent for drawing wrenching performances from his actors ( improvised over many months ) and for conveying the way tiny acts of kindness make ordinary life survivable . 
-1 the problem isn't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball . 
+1 this is a nicely handled affair , a film about human darkness but etched with a light ( yet unsentimental ) touch . 
+1 in its understanding , often funny way , it tells a story whose restatement is validated by the changing composition of the nation .

-1 often likable , but just as often it's meandering , low on energy , and too eager to be quirky at moments when a little old-fashioned storytelling would come in handy . 
-1 a film which presses familiar herzog tropes into the service of a limpid and conventional historical fiction , when really what we demand of the director is to be mesmerised . 
+1 what saves it . . . and makes it one of the better video-game-based flicks , is that the film acknowledges upfront that the plot makes no sense , such that the lack of linearity is the point of emotional and moral departure for protagonist alice .

+1 just about the best straight-up , old-school horror film of the last 15 years . 
+1 a hard look at one man's occupational angst and its subsequent reinvention , a terrifying study of bourgeois desperation worthy of claude chabrol .

+1 if you sometimes like to go to the movies to have fun , wasabi is a good place to start .

-1 none of birthday girl's calculated events take us by surprise . . . 
+1 a pointed , often tender , examination of the pros and cons of unconditional love and familial duties .

-1 pure of intention and passably diverting , his secret life is light , innocuous and unremarkable . 
+1 what lee does so marvelously compelling is present brown as a catalyst for the struggle of black manhood in restrictive and chaotic america . . . sketchy but nevertheless gripping portrait of jim brown , a celebrated wonder in the spotlight
+1 it's a powerful though flawed movie , guaranteed to put a lump in your throat while reaffirming washington as possibly the best actor working in movies today .

+1 fans of critics' darling band wilco will marvel at the sometimes murky , always brooding look of i am trying to break your heart .

+1 a remarkable film by bernard rose .

+1 exciting and well-paced .

+1 those who want to be jolted out of their gourd should drop everything and run to ichi . 
+1 a deceivingly simple film , one that grows in power in retrospect . 
-1 if a few good men told us that we " can't handle the truth " than high crimes poetically states at one point in this movie that we " don't care about the truth . " 
+1 decasia is what has happened already to so many silent movies , newsreels and the like . the unexpected thing is that its dying , in this shower of black-and-white psychedelia , is quite beautiful .

+1 filmmakers david weissman and bill weber benefit enormously from the cockettes' camera craziness -- not only did they film performances , but they did the same at home . 
+1 overall , cletis tout is a winning comedy that excites the imagination and tickles the funny bone . 
-1 it's been 13 months and 295 preview screenings since i last walked out on a movie , but resident evil really earned my indignant , preemptive departure . 
+1 deep intelligence and a warm , enveloping affection breathe out of every frame . 
+1 a hallmark film in an increasingly important film industry and worth the look .

+1 provides a satisfactory overview of the bizarre world of extreme athletes as several daredevils express their own views . 
+1 for every cheesy scene , though , there is a really cool bit -- the movie's conception of a future-world holographic librarian ( orlando jones ) who knows everything and answers all questions , is visually smart , cleverly written , and nicely realized . 
-1 birot is a competent enough filmmaker , but her story has nothing fresh or very exciting about it . 
-1 director tom shadyac and star kevin costner glumly mishandle the story's promising premise of a physician who needs to heal himself .

-1 a sleep-inducing thriller with a single twist that everyone except the characters in it can see coming a mile away . 
+1 the hard-to-predict and absolutely essential chemistry between the down-to-earth bullock and the nonchalant grant proves to be sensational , and everything meshes in this elegant entertainment . 
+1 it's the kind of effectively creepy-scary thriller that has you fixating on a far corner of the screen at times because your nerves just can't take it any more . 
-1 check your brain and your secret agent decoder ring at the door because you don't want to think too much about what's going on . the movie does has some entertainment value - how much depends on how well you like chris rock . 
+1 not too fancy , not too filling , not too fluffy , but definitely tasty and sweet . 
+1 it's obviously struck a responsive chord with many south koreans , and should work its magic in other parts of the world . 
+1 like kubrick , soderbergh isn't afraid to try any genre and to do it his own way . 
-1 a harmless and mildly amusing family comedy . 
+1 despite a quieter middle section , involving aragorn's dreams of arwen , this is even better than the fellowship . there are scenes of cinematic perfection that steal your heart away .

-1 poor editing , bad bluescreen , and ultra-cheesy dialogue highlight the radical action . 
-1 [swimfan] falls victim to sloppy plotting , an insultingly unbelievable final act and a villainess who is too crazy to be interesting .

+1 polished korean political-action film is just as good -- and bad -- as hollywood action epics . is this progress ?

+1 in the affable maid in manhattan , jennifer lopez's most aggressive and most sincere attempt to take movies by storm , the diva shrewdly surrounds herself with a company of strictly a-list players .

-1 the iditarod lasts for days - this just felt like it did . 
-1 it's so devoid of joy and energy it makes even jason x . . . look positively shakesperean by comparison . 
+1 the performances of the four main actresses bring their characters to life . a little melodramatic , but with enough hope to keep you engaged . 
-1 this film was made by and for those folks who collect the serial killer cards and are fascinated by the mere suggestion of serial killers . for the rest of us , sitting through dahmer's two hours amounts to little more than punishment . 
-1 impostor has a handful of thrilling moments and a couple of good performances , but the movie doesn't quite fly . for starters , the story is just too slim . 
-1 overall , it's a pretty mediocre family film . 
+1 while insomnia is in many ways a conventional , even predictable remake , nolan's penetrating undercurrent of cerebral and cinemantic flair lends ( it ) stimulating depth . 
+1 an enthralling , playful film that constantly frustrates our desire to know the 'truth' about this man , while deconstructing the very format of the biography in a manner that derrida would doubtless give his blessing to . 
-1 you'd be hard put to find a movie character more unattractive or odorous [than leon] . 
+1 the kind of nervous film that will either give you a mild headache or exhilarate you .

+1 an ebullient tunisian film about the startling transformation of a tradition-bound widow who is drawn into the exotic world of belly dancing . 
+1 if you ever wanted to be an astronaut , this is the ultimate movie experience - it's informative and breathtakingly spectacular . 
-1  . . . too contrived to be as naturally charming as it needs to be . 
-1 maybe it's the star power of the cast or the redundant messages , but something aboul " full frontal " seems , well , contrived . 
+1 adaptation is intricately constructed and in a strange way nails all of orlean's themes without being a true adaptation of her book .

-1 the overall effect is less like a children's movie than a recruitment film for future hollywood sellouts . 
+1 mostly honest , this somber picture reveals itself slowly , intelligently , artfully . 
-1 like a comedian who starts off promisingly but then proceeds to flop , comedian runs out of steam after a half hour . 
+1 not only a coming-of-age story and cautionary parable , but also a perfectly rendered period piece . 
-1 the action scenes have all the suspense of a 20-car pileup , while the plot holes are big enough for a train car to drive through -- if kaos hadn't blown them all up . 
+1 by the standards of knucklehead swill , the hot chick is pretty damned funny . 
+1 all-in-all , the film is an enjoyable and frankly told tale of a people who live among us , but not necessarily with us .

-1 shafer's feature doesn't offer much in terms of plot or acting . 
+1 it's fairly self-aware in its dumbness . 
+1 boldly engineering a collision between tawdry b-movie flamboyance and grandiose spiritual anomie , rose's film , true to its source material , provides a tenacious demonstration of death as the great equalizer . 
-1 too silly to be frightening , too stolid to be funny , it projects the same lazy affability as its nominal star , david arquette . 
+1 lovely and poignant . puts a human face on a land most westerners are unfamiliar with . 
-1 the good thing -- the only good thing -- about extreme ops is that it's so inane that it gave me plenty of time to ponder my thanksgiving to-do list . 
+1 it makes compelling , provocative and prescient viewing . 
-1 as written by michael berg and michael j . wilson from a story by wilson , this relentless , all-wise-guys-all-the-time approach tries way too hard and gets tiring in no time at all .

+1 not since tom cruise in risky business has an actor made such a strong impression in his underwear . 
+1 a colorful , vibrant introduction to a universal human impulse , lushly photographed and beautifully recorded . 
-1 narc is all menace and atmosphere . 
+1 a generous , inspiring film that unfolds with grace and humor and gradually becomes a testament to faith . 
+1 a thoughtful , reverent portrait of what is essentially a subculture , with its own rules regarding love and family , governance and hierarchy . 
-1 the acting is just fine , but there's not enough substance here to sustain interest for the full 90 minutes , especially with the weak payoff . 
+1 a lot of fun , with an undeniable energy sparked by two actresses in their 50s working at the peak of their powers . 
-1 william shatner , as a pompous professor , is the sole bright spot . . . 
-1 is " ballistic " worth the price of admission ? absolutely not . it sucked . would i see it again ? please see previous answer . 
-1 a determined , ennui-hobbled slog that really doesn't have much to say beyond the news flash that loneliness can make people act weird . 
+1 everywhere the camera looks there is something worth seeing . 
-1 there is no psychology here , and no real narrative logic -- just a series of carefully choreographed atrocities , which become strangely impersonal and abstract . 
-1 the pacing is often way off and there are too many bona fide groaners among too few laughs . 
-1 exhibits the shallow sensationalism characteristic of soap opera . . . more salacious telenovela than serious drama . 
+1 [næs] directed the stage version of elling , and gets fine performances from his two leads who originated the characters on stage . 
+1 the film often achieves a mesmerizing poetry . 
-1 drumline is -- the mere suggestion , albeit a visually compelling one , of a fully realized story . 
+1 for those of an indulgent , slightly sunbaked and summery mind , sex and lucia may well prove diverting enough . 
+1 yakusho , as always , is wonderful as the long-faced sad sack . . . and his chemistry with shimizu is very believable . 
-1 there is not a character in the movie with a shred of plausibility , not an event that is believable , not a confrontation that is not staged , not a moment that is not false . 
+1 close enough in spirit to its freewheeling trash-cinema roots to be a breath of fresh air . 
-1 it's got the brawn , but not the brains . 
+1 the magic of the film lies not in the mysterious spring but in the richness of its performances . 
-1 a porn film without the sex scenes . 
-1 scooby dooby doo / and shaggy too / you both look and sound great . / but daphne , you're too buff / fred thinks he's tough / and velma - wow , you've lost weight ! 
-1 a sluggish pace and lack of genuine narrative hem the movie in every bit as much as life hems in the spirits of these young women . 
-1 mark wahlberg . . . may look classy in a '60s-homage pokepie hat , but as a character he's dry , dry , dry . 
+1 really quite funny . 
+1 a beautiful , entertaining two hours . you get the idea , though , that kapur intended the film to be more than that . 
+1 jagger , stoppard and director michael apted . . . deliver a riveting and surprisingly romantic ride . 
-1 first-time director joão pedro rodrigues' unwillingness to define his hero's background or motivations becomes more and more frustrating as the film goes on . 
+1 does what a fine documentary does best : it extends a warm invitation into an unfamiliar world , then illuminates it fully and allows the larger implications of the journey to sink in unobtrusively . 
+1 a clever script and skilled actors bring new energy to the familiar topic of office politics . 
+1 in the end there is one word that best describes this film : honest . 
+1 sly , sophisticated and surprising . 
-1 a puzzle whose pieces do not fit . some are fascinating and others are not , and in the end , it is almost a good movie . 
-1 it's lost the politics and the social observation and become just another situation romance about a couple of saps stuck in an inarticulate screenplay . 
-1 audiences can be expected to suspend their disbelief only so far -- and that does not include the 5 o'clock shadow on the tall wooden kid as he skips off to school . 
-1 handsome and sincere but slightly awkward in its combination of entertainment and evangelical boosterism . 
-1 'men in black ii creates a new threat for the mib , but recycles the same premise . 
-1 so few movies explore religion that it's disappointing to see one reduce it to an idea that fits in a sampler . 
+1 an unbelievably fun film just a leading man away from perfection . 
-1 a prolonged extrusion of psychopathic pulp . 
-1 narc can only remind us of brilliant crime dramas without becoming one itself . 
-1  . . . while the humor aspects of 'jason x' were far more entertaining than i had expected , everything else about the film tanks . 
+1  ( danny huston gives ) an astounding performance that deftly , gradually reveals a real human soul buried beneath a spellbinding serpent's smirk . 
-1 it would be churlish to begrudge anyone for receiving whatever consolation that can be found in dragonfly , yet it is impossible to find the film anything but appalling , shamelessly manipulative and contrived , and totally lacking in conviction . 
+1 familiar but utterly delightful . 
-1 sodden and glum , even in those moments where it's supposed to feel funny and light . 
-1 the tone shifts abruptly from tense to celebratory to soppy . 
+1 the cast , collectively a successful example of the lovable-loser protagonist , shows deft comic timing . 
+1 what it lacks in substance it makes up for in heart . 
+1 one of the smartest takes on singles culture i've seen in a long time . 
-1 might be one of those vanity projects in which a renowned filmmaker attempts to show off his talent by surrounding himself with untalented people . 
-1 despite engaging offbeat touches , knockaround guys rarely seems interested in kicking around a raison d'etre that's as fresh-faced as its young-guns cast . 
+1 denver should not get the first and last look at one of the most triumphant performances of vanessa redgrave's career . it deserves to be seen everywhere . 
-1 what we get . . . is caddyshack crossed with the loyal order of raccoons . 
+1 it's usually a bad sign when directors abandon their scripts and go where the moment takes them , but olympia , wash . , based filmmakers anne de marcken and marilyn freeman did just that and it's what makes their project so interesting . 
-1 the plot grows thin soon , and you find yourself praying for a quick resolution . 
+1 the script manages the rare trick of seeming at once both refreshingly different and reassuringly familiar . 
-1 the first question to ask about bad company is why anthony hopkins is in it . we assume he had a bad run in the market or a costly divorce , because there is no earthly reason other than money why this distinguished actor would stoop so low . 
-1 it's exactly what you'd expect . 
-1 the nicest thing that can be said about stealing harvard ( which might have been called freddy gets molested by a dog ) is that it's not as obnoxious as tom green's freddie got fingered . 
+1  . . . strips bible stores of the potential for sanctimoniousness , making them meaningful for both kids and church-wary adults . 
+1 the performances of the children , untrained in acting , have an honesty and dignity that breaks your heart . 
+1 jackie chan movies are a guilty pleasure - he's easy to like and always leaves us laughing . 
-1 just entertaining enough not to hate , too mediocre to love . 
+1 [washington's] strong hand , keen eye , sweet spirit and good taste are reflected in almost every scene . 
+1 the urban landscapes are detailed down to the signs on the kiosks , and the color palette , with lots of somber blues and pinks , is dreamy and evocative . 
-1 once again , director chris columbus takes a hat-in-hand approach to rowling that stifles creativity and allows the film to drag on for nearly three hours .

-1 appropriately cynical social commentary aside , #9 never quite ignites . 
+1 every individual will see the movie through the prism of his or her own beliefs and prejudices , but the one thing most will take away is the sense that peace is possible . that , in itself , is extraordinary . 
-1 the good is very , very good . . . the rest runs from mildly unimpressive to despairingly awful . 
+1 based on a devilishly witty script by heather mcgowan and niels mueller , the film gets great laughs , but never at the expense of its characters
-1 for a shoot-'em-up , ballistic is oddly lifeless . 
+1 a stylish but steady , and ultimately very satisfying , piece of character-driven storytelling . 
+1 tony gayton's script doesn't give us anything we haven't seen before , but director d . j . caruso's grimy visual veneer and kilmer's absorbing performance increase the gravitational pull considerably . 
+1 family portrait of need , neurosis and nervy negativity is a rare treat that shows the promise of digital filmmaking . 
+1 sayles is making a statement about the inability of dreams and aspirations to carry forward into the next generation . 
-1 two big things are missing -- anything approaching a visceral kick , and anything approaching even a vague reason to sit through it all . 
-1 a small fortune in salaries and stunt cars might have been saved if the director , tom dey , had spliced together bits and pieces of midnight run and 48 hours ( and , for that matter , shrek ) . 
+1 [reynolds] takes a classic story , casts attractive and talented actors and uses a magnificent landscape to create a feature film that is wickedly fun to watch . 
-1 the nonstop artifice ultimately proves tiresome , with the surface histrionics failing to compensate for the paper-thin characterizations and facile situations . 
+1 if you're in the mood for a bollywood film , here's one for you . 
+1 the farcical elements seemed too pat and familiar to hold my interest , yet its diverting grim message is a good one . 
+1 you don't have to know about music to appreciate the film's easygoing blend of comedy and romance . 
+1 a smart , sassy and exceptionally charming romantic comedy . 
-1 a great ending doesn't make up for a weak movie , and crazy as hell doesn't even have a great ending . 
-1 the thought of watching this film with an audience full of teenagers fixating on its body humour and reinforcement of stereotypes ( of which they'll get plenty ) fills me with revulsion . 
+1 in imax in short , it's just as wonderful on the big screen . 
-1 the movie resolutely avoids all the comic possibilities of its situation , and becomes one more dumb high school comedy about sex gags and prom dates . 
-1 a non-mystery mystery . 
-1 [morgan] , judd and franklin can't save the script , rooted in a novel by joseph finder , from some opportunism . 
-1 wasabi is slight fare indeed , with the entire project having the feel of something tossed off quickly ( like one of hubert's punches ) , but it should go down smoothly enough with popcorn . 
+1 dogtown & z-boys evokes the blithe rebel fantasy with the kind of insouciance embedded in the sexy demise of james dean . 
-1 ponderous , plodding soap opera disguised as a feature film . 
+1 the pitch must have read like a discarded house beautiful spread . 
-1  . . . if it had been only half-an-hour long or a tv special , the humor would have been fast and furious-- at ninety minutes , it drags . 
+1 an enjoyable above average summer diversion . 
+1  . . . one of the more influential works of the 'korean new wave' . 
+1 writer/director mark romanek spotlights the underlying caste system in america . it's a scathing portrayal . 
+1 a poignant , artfully crafted meditation on mortality . 
+1 the movie is well crafted , and well executed . if you're paying attention , the " big twists " are pretty easy to guess - but that doesn't make the movie any less entertaining . 
-1 stealing harvard doesn't care about cleverness , wit or any other kind of intelligent humor . 
-1 though catch me if you can isn't badly made , the fun slowly leaks out of the movie . 
-1 a sincere but dramatically conflicted gay coming-of-age tale . 
-1 splashes its drama all over the screen , subjecting its audience and characters to action that feels not only manufactured , but also so false you can see the filmmakers' puppet strings . 
-1 with the cheesiest monsters this side of a horror spoof , which they isn't , it is more likely to induce sleep than fright . 
-1 pretend like your sat scores are below 120 and you might not notice the flaws . 
-1 a singularly off-putting romantic comedy . 
+1 shot in rich , shadowy black-and-white , devils chronicles , with increasingly amused irony , the relationship between reluctant captors and befuddled captives . 
+1 it's a coming-of-age story we've all seen bits of in other films -- but it's rarely been told with such affecting grace and cultural specificity . 
+1 smart science fiction for grown-ups , with only a few false steps along the way . 
-1 there is very little dread or apprehension , and though i like the creepy ideas , they are not executed with anything more than perfunctory skill . 
-1 hard-core slasher aficionados will find things to like . . . but overall the halloween series has lost its edge . 
+1 it's a familiar story , but one that is presented with great sympathy and intelligence . 
-1  " the kid stays in the picture " is a great story , terrifically told by the man who wrote it but this cliff notes edition is a cheat . 
-1 a faster paced family flick . upper teens may get cynical . smaller numbered kidlets will enjoy . 
-1 [gayton's script] telegraphs every discovery and layers on the gloss of convenience . 
+1 one hour photo is an intriguing snapshot of one man and his delusions ; it's just too bad it doesn't have more flashes of insight . 
+1 the movie stays afloat thanks to its hallucinatory production design . 
+1 narc is a no-bull throwback to 1970s action films . it zips along with b-movie verve while adding the rich details and go-for-broke acting that heralds something special . 
+1 a pleasant enough romance with intellectual underpinnings , the kind of movie that entertains even as it turns maddeningly predictable . 
-1 the movie spends more time with schneider than with newcomer mcadams , even though her performance is more interesting ( and funnier ) than his . 
-1 sluggishly directed by episodic tv veteran joe zwick , it's a sitcom without the snap-crackle . 
+1 an unsettling , memorable cinematic experience that does its predecessors proud . 
-1 there's not a spark of new inspiration in it , just more of the same , done with noticeably less energy and imagination . 
+1 an average kid-empowerment fantasy with slightly above-average brains . 
-1 downbeat , period-perfect biopic hammers home a heavy-handed moralistic message . 
+1 the film's only missteps come from the script's insistence on providing deep emotional motivation for each and every one of abagnale's antics . 
+1 just another fish-out-of-water story that barely stays afloat . 
+1 those who aren't put off by the film's austerity will find it more than capable of rewarding them . 
+1 westfeldt and juergensen exude a chemistry and comfort level that's both saucy and endearing . 
-1 no amount of arty theorizing -- the special effects are 'german-expressionist , ' according to the press notes -- can render it anything but laughable . 
-1  " the tuxedo " should have been the vehicle for chan that " the mask " was for jim carrey . alas , it's the man that makes the clothes . 
+1 superb production values & christian bale's charisma make up for a derivative plot . 
-1 the film flat lines when it should peak and is more missed opportunity and trifle than dark , decadent truffle . 
-1 this thing works on no level whatsoever for me . 
-1 you could nap for an hour and not miss a thing . 
-1 full of flatulence jokes and mild sexual references , kung pow ! is the kind of movie that's critic-proof , simply because it aims so low . 
+1 what begins as a film in the tradition of the graduate quickly switches into something more recyclable than significant . 
+1 daring and beautifully made . 
-1  . . . the kind of movie you see because the theater has air conditioning . 
+1 enjoy it for what it is ; you can hate yourself later . 
+1 renner ? s face is chillingly unemotive , yet he communicates a great deal in his performance . see it for his performance if nothing else . 
+1 open-minded kids -- kids who read , kids who dream -- will be comforted by the way it deals with big issues like death and destiny . 
+1 if you're a fan of the series you'll love it and probably want to see it twice . i will be . 
-1 a sentimental mess that never rings true . 
+1 the second chapter of the harry potter series is even more magical than the first and simply the best family film of the year . 
+1 it's the best film of the year so far , the benchmark against which all other best picture contenders should be measured . 
-1 every potential twist is telegraphed well in advance , every performance respectably muted ; the movie itself seems to have been made under the influence of rohypnol . 
+1 this is a very fine movie -- go see it . 
+1 at its best , the good girl is a refreshingly adult take on adultery . . . 
+1 the imax screen enhances the personal touch of manual animation . 
+1 reinforces the talents of screenwriter charlie kaufman , creator of adaptation and being john malkovich . 
+1 what full frontal lacks in thematic coherence it largely makes up for as loosey-goosey , experimental entertainment . still , i'm not quite sure what the point is
-1 rather quickly , the film falls into a soothing formula of brotherly conflict and reconciliation . 
+1 this ecologically minded , wildlife friendly film teaches good ethics while entertaining with its unconventionally wacky but loving family
-1 you expect more from director michael apted ( enigma ) and screenwriter nicholas kazan ( reversal of fortune ) than this cliche pileup . 
+1 both a detective story and a romance spiced with the intrigue of academic skullduggery and politics . 
+1 a positively thrilling combination of ethnography and all the intrigue , betrayal , deceit and murder of a shakespearean tragedy or a juicy soap opera . 
-1 the worst kind of independent ; the one where actors play dress down hicks and ponderously mope around trying to strike lightning as captured by their 1970s predecessors
+1 a terrifically entertaining specimen of spielbergian sci-fi . 
+1 writer-director's mehta's effort has tons of charm and the whimsy is in the mixture , the intoxicating masala , of cultures and film genres . 
+1 like most bond outings in recent years , some of the stunts are so outlandish that they border on being cartoonlike . a heavy reliance on cgi technology is beginning to creep into the series . 
-1 ben affleck as jack ryan , tom clancy's intrepid hero ? ridiculous . what's next ? d . j . qualls as indiana jones ? or tom green as han solo ? 
-1 an empty , ugly exercise in druggy trance-noir and trumped-up street credibility . 
+1 much monkeyfun for all . 
+1 from the dull , surreal ache of mortal awareness emerges a radiant character portrait . 
-1 `martin lawrence live' is so self-pitying , i almost expected there to be a collection taken for the comedian at the end of the show . 
-1 a by-the-numbers effort that won't do much to enhance the franchise . 
+1 nettelbeck has crafted an engaging fantasy of flavours and emotions , one part romance novel , one part recipe book . 
+1 the subtle strength of " elling " is that it never loses touch with the reality of the grim situation . 
-1 most of the action setups are incoherent . 
+1 the movie isn't just hilarious : it's witty and inventive , too , and in hindsight , it isn't even all that dumb . 
-1 it's mildly amusing , but i certainly can't recommend it . 
+1  . . . one of the most entertaining monster movies in ages . . . 
+1 literary purists may not be pleased , but as far as mainstream matinee-style entertainment goes , it does a bang-up job of pleasing the crowds . 
-1 broder's screenplay is shallow , offensive and redundant , with pitifully few real laughs . 
+1 an engrossing portrait of a man whose engaging manner and flamboyant style made him a truly larger-than-life character . 
-1 a major waste . . . generic . 
+1 triumph of love is a very silly movie , but the silliness has a pedigree . 
+1 what's surprising about full frontal is that despite its overt self-awareness , parts of the movie still manage to break past the artifice and thoroughly engage you . 
+1 this breezy caper movie becomes a soulful , incisive meditation on the way we were , and the way we are . 
+1 insomnia is involving . still , i thought it could have been more . 
-1 a living testament to the power of the eccentric and the strange . the fact that it isn't very good is almost beside the point . 
+1 a warm but realistic meditation on friendship , family and affection . 
+1 one of the more intelligent children's movies to hit theaters this year . 
-1 as inept as big-screen remakes of the avengers and the wild wild west . 
+1 arteta directs one of the best ensemble casts of the year
+1 it's a terrific american sports movie and dennis quaid is its athletic heart . 
-1 a superfluous sequel . . . plagued by that old familiar feeling of 'let's get this thing over with' : everyone has shown up at the appointed time and place , but visible enthusiasm is mighty hard to find . 
+1 while the path may be familiar , first-time director denzel washington and a top-notch cast manage to keep things interesting . 
-1 too silly to take seriously . 
+1 my wife is an actress has its moments in looking at the comic effects of jealousy . in the end , though , it is only mildly amusing when it could have been so much more . 
-1 cruel and inhuman cinematic punishment . . . simultaneously degrades its characters , its stars and its audience . 
+1 the hypnotic imagery and fragmentary tale explore the connections between place and personal identity . 
-1 it takes a really long , slow and dreary time to dope out what tuck everlasting is about . so here it is : it's about a family of sour immortals . 
-1 the title helpfully offers the most succinct review of it you'll read anywhere . 
+1 the last scenes of the film are anguished , bitter and truthful . mr . koshashvili is a director to watch . 
-1 they were afraid to show this movie to reviewers before its opening , afraid of the bad reviews they thought they'd earn . they were right . 
-1 a spooky yarn of demonic doings on the high seas that works better the less the brain is engaged . 
-1 the re- enactments , however fascinating they may be as history , are too crude to serve the work especially well . 
-1 all this turns out to be neither funny nor provocative - only dull . 
+1 jose campanella delivers a loosely autobiographical story brushed with sentimentality but brimming with gentle humor , bittersweet pathos , and lyric moments that linger like snapshots of memory . 
+1 the film is just a big , gorgeous , mind-blowing , breath-taking mess . 
-1 a handsome but unfulfilling suspense drama more suited to a quiet evening on pbs than a night out at an amc . 
-1 the movie doesn't generate a lot of energy . it is dark , brooding and slow , and takes its central idea way too seriously . 
-1 what could have been a pointed little chiller about the frightening seductiveness of new technology loses faith in its own viability and succumbs to joyless special-effects excess . 
+1  . . . an inviting piece of film . 
-1 [l]ame and unnecessary . 
-1 that is essentially what's missing from blackboards -- the sense of something bigger , some ultimate point . 
-1 the movie's blatant derivativeness is one reason it's so lackluster . 
+1 a well-put-together piece of urban satire . 
-1 the innocence of holiday cheer ain't what it used to be . 
-1 first good , then bothersome . excellent acting and direction . 
+1 newton draws our attention like a magnet , and acts circles around her better known co-star , mark wahlberg . 
+1 the movie isn't always easy to look at . but if it is indeed a duty of art to reflect life , than leigh has created a masterful piece of artistry right here . 
-1 it has the requisite faux-urban vibe and hotter-two-years-ago rap and r&b names and references . 
-1 no such thing breaks no new ground and treads old turf like a hippopotamus ballerina . 
+1 as antonia is assimilated into this newfangled community , the film settles in and becomes compulsively watchable in a guilty-pleasure , daytime-drama sort of fashion . 
-1  . . . stumbles over every cheap trick in the book trying to make the outrage come even easier . 
+1 there's a lot to recommend read my lips . 
-1 the fight scenes are fun , but it grows tedious . 
-1 an awful snooze . 
-1 while the new film is much more eye-catching than its blood-drenched stephen norrington-directed predecessor , the new script by the returning david s . goyer is much sillier . 
-1 this overproduced and generally disappointing effort isn't likely to rouse the rush hour crowd . 
+1 a seriocomic debut of extravagant promise by georgian-israeli director dover kosashvili . 
-1 it's mildly interesting to ponder the peculiar american style of justice that plays out here , but it's so muddled and derivative that few will bother thinking it all through . 
-1 when mr . hundert tells us in his narration that 'this is a story without surprises , ' we nod in agreement . 
+1 at the film's centre is a precisely layered performance by an actor in his mid-seventies , michel piccoli . 
+1 with 'bowling for columbine , ' michael moore gives us the perfect starting point for a national conversation about guns , violence , and fear . 
+1 williams absolutely nails sy's queasy infatuation and overall strangeness . 
+1 my big fat greek wedding is not only the best date movie of the year , it's also a -- dare i say it twice -- delightfully charming -- and totally american , i might add -- slice of comedic bliss . 
+1 my wife is an actress is an utterly charming french comedy that feels so american in sensibility and style it's virtually its own hollywood remake . 
-1 there's a scientific law to be discerned here that producers would be well to heed : mediocre movies start to drag as soon as the action speeds up ; when the explosions start , they fall to pieces . 
+1 an entertaining , if somewhat standardized , action movie . 
+1 made for teens and reviewed as such , this is recommended only for those under 20 years of age . . . and then only as a very mild rental . 
+1 not so much a movie as a picture book for the big screen . this isn't my favorite in the series , still i enjoyed it enough to recommend . 
+1 ruzowitzky has taken this mothball-y stuff and made a rather sturdy , old-fashioned entertainment out of it . 
+1 a movie that both thrills the eye and , in its over-the-top way , touches the heart . 
+1 saddled with an unwieldy cast of characters and angles , but the payoff is powerful and revelatory . 
-1  . . . too dull to enjoy . 
-1 there are films that try the patience of even the most cinema-besotted critic -- and this was one of them . 
+1 in all fairness , i must report that the children of varying ages in my audience never coughed , fidgeted or romped up and down the aisles for bathroom breaks . 
+1 the vistas are sweeping and the acting is far from painful . 
+1 a delicious , quirky movie with a terrific screenplay and fanciful direction by michael gondry . 
-1 unfunny and lacking any sense of commitment to or affection for its characters , the reginald hudlin comedy relies on toilet humor , ethnic slurs . 
+1 it extends the writings of jean genet and john rechy , the films of fassbinder , perhaps even the nocturnal works of goya . 
+1 it's a fairy tale that comes from a renowned indian film culture that allows americans to finally revel in its splendor . 
-1 yet another entry in the sentimental oh-those-wacky-brits genre that was ushered in by the full monty and is still straining to produce another smash hit . 
-1 both overstuffed and undernourished . . . the film can't be called a solid success , although there's plenty of evidence here to indicate clooney might have better luck next time . 
+1 captivates as it shows excess in business and pleasure , allowing us to find the small , human moments , and leaving off with a grand whimper . 
-1 there's no denying the elaborateness of the artist's conceptions , nor his ability to depict them with outrageous elan , but really the whole series is so much pretentious nonsense , lavishly praised by those who equate obscurity with profundity . 
+1 cuaron repeatedly , perversely undercuts the joie de vivre even as he creates it , giving the movie a mournful undercurrent that places the good-time shenanigans in welcome perspective . 
-1 the movie is undone by a filmmaking methodology that's just experimental enough to alienate the mainstream audience while ringing cliched to hardened indie-heads . 
-1 it's hard not to feel you've just watched a feature-length video game with some really heavy back story . 
+1 the film hinges on its performances , and both leads are up to the task . 
+1 an enjoyably half-wit remake of the venerable italian comedy big deal on madonna street . 
+1 this humbling little film , fueled by the light comedic work of zhao benshan and the delicate ways of dong jie , is just the sort for those moviegoers who complain that 'they don't make movies like they used to anymore . '
-1  " the time machine " is a movie that has no interest in itself . it doesn't believe in itself , it has no sense of humorit's just plain bored . 
-1 it appears as if even the filmmakers didn't know what kind of movie they were making . 
-1 the film is itself a sort of cinematic high crime , one that brings military courtroom dramas down very , very low . 
+1 an engaging overview of johnson's eccentric career . 
+1 call me a wimp , but i cried , not once , but three times in this animated sweet film . 
+1 if signs is a good film , and it is , the essence of a great one is in there somewhere . 
+1 andersson creates a world that's at once surreal and disturbingly familiar ; absurd , yet tremendously sad . 
+1 the film , despite the gratuitous cinematic distractions impressed upon it , is still good fun . 
+1 as blunt as it is in depicting child abuse , el bola is a movie steeped in an ambiguity that lends its conflicts a symbolic resonance . 
+1 a perceptive , good-natured movie . 
-1 it feels like very light errol morris , focusing on eccentricity but failing , ultimately , to make something bigger out of its scrapbook of oddballs . 
-1 there's something fundamental missing from this story : something or someone to care about . 
-1 chai's structure and pacing are disconcertingly slack . 
+1 the movie's quiet affirmation of neighborhood values gives it an honest , lived-in glow . 
-1 the characters are based on stock clichés , and the attempt to complicate the story only defies credibility . 
-1 it seems just a long , convoluted ploy to get men into drag -- period drag , no less . 
+1 it's sweet . it's funny . it wears its heart on the sleeve of its gaudy hawaiian shirt . and , thanks to the presence of 'the king , ' it also rocks . 
-1 schnieder bounces around with limp wrists , wearing tight tummy tops and hip huggers , twirling his hair on his finger and assuming that's enough to sustain laughs . . . 
-1 there must be an audience that enjoys the friday series , but i wouldn't be interested in knowing any of them personally . 
-1  . . . a rather bland affair . 
+1 the script by david koepp is perfectly serviceable and because he gives the story some soul . . . he elevates the experience to a more mythic level . 
+1 this comic gem is as delightful as it is derivative . 
-1 the problem is that for the most part , the film is deadly dull . 
-1 this is the kind of movie during which you want to bang your head on the seat in front of you , at its cluelessness , at its idiocy , at its utterly misplaced earnestness . 
-1 the whole talking-animal thing is grisly . 
-1 a movie that falls victim to frazzled wackiness and frayed satire . 
+1 as a thoughtful and unflinching examination of an alternative lifestyle , sex with strangers is a success . 
-1 i found myself more appreciative of what the director was trying to do than of what he had actually done . 
-1 mattei is tiresomely grave and long-winded , as if circularity itself indicated profundity . 
+1 despite the long running time , the pace never feels slack -- there's no scene that screams " bathroom break ! " 
-1 not a movie but a live-action agitprop cartoon so shameless and coarse , it's almost funny . 
-1 mandel holland's direction is uninspired , and his scripting unsurprising , but the performances by phifer and black are ultimately winning . you'll find yourself wishing that you and they were in another movie . 
-1 a movie more to be prescribed than recommended -- as visually bland as a dentist's waiting room , complete with soothing muzak and a cushion of predictable narrative rhythms . 
+1 the re-release of ron howard's apollo 13 in the imax format proves absolutely that really , really , really good things can come in enormous packages . 
+1 this is dicaprio's best performance in anything ever , and easily the most watchable film of the year . 
+1 lends itself to the narcotizing bland ( sinister , though not nearly so sinister as the biennial disney girl movie ) machinations of the biennial disney boy movie . 
-1 mild , meandering teen flick . 
+1 what could have become just another cautionary fable is allowed to play out as a clever , charming tale  as pleasantly in its own way as its self-dramatizing characters . 
-1 the mothman prophecies , which is mostly a bore , seems to exist only for its climactic setpiece . 
+1 the cast comes through even when the movie doesn't . 
-1 diane lane's sophisticated performance can't rescue adrian lyne's unfaithful from its sleazy moralizing . 
-1 hart's war seems to want to be a character study , but apparently can't quite decide which character . 
+1 it's probably worth catching solely on its visual merits . if only it had the story to match . 
-1 as happily glib and vicious as its characters . 
-1 too slick and manufactured to claim street credibility . 
+1 some people want the ol' ball-and-chain and then there are those who just want the ball and chain . 
-1 contains a few big laughs but many more that graze the funny bone or miss it altogether , in part because the consciously dumbed-down approach wears thin . 
+1 efteriades gives the neighborhood -- scenery , vibe and all -- the cinematic equivalent of a big , tender hug . 
+1 the whole mildly pleasant outing -- the r rating is for brief nudity and a grisly corpse -- remains aloft not on its own self-referential hot air , but on the inspired performance of tim allen . 
+1 director juan jose campanella could have turned this into an argentine retread of " iris " or " american beauty , " but instead pulls a little from each film and creates something more beautiful than either of those films . 
-1 just like the deli sandwich : lots of ham , lots of cheese , with a sickly sweet coating to disguise its excrescence until just after ( or during ) consumption of its second half . 
+1 it's virtually impossible to like any of these despicable characters . 
+1 mostly , [goldbacher] just lets her complicated characters be unruly , confusing and , through it all , human . 
-1 the movie strains to stay on the light , comic side of the issue , despite the difficulty of doing so when dealing with the destruction of property and , potentially , of life itself . 
+1 the movie is saved from unbearable lightness by the simplicity of the storytelling and the authenticity of the performances . 
-1 the one not-so-small problem with expecting is that the entire exercise has no real point . 
-1 below is well below expectations . 
-1 the hanukkah spirit seems fried in pork . 
-1 behind the glitz , hollywood is sordid and disgusting . quelle surprise ! 
+1 if you love motown music , you'll love this documentary . 
+1 this fascinating experiment plays as more of a poetic than a strict reality , creating an intriguing species of artifice that gives the lady and the duke something of a theatrical air . 
+1 ultimately feels empty and unsatisfying , like swallowing a communion wafer without the wine . 
+1 essentially an exceptionally well-written , well-edited , well-directed , well-acted , bald rip-off of aliens . 
+1 the quality of the art combined with the humor and intelligence of the script allow the filmmakers to present the biblical message of forgiveness without it ever becoming preachy or syrupy . 
-1 scorsese at his best makes gangster films that are equally lovely but also relentlessly brutal and brutally intelligent ; perdition , meanwhile , reads more like driving miss daisy than goodfellas . 
+1 one of the best films i have ever seen , constantly pulling the rug from underneath us , seeing things from new sides , plunging deeper , getting more intense . 
+1 it's an offbeat treat that pokes fun at the democratic exercise while also examining its significance for those who take part . 
-1 it all comes down to whether you can tolerate leon barlow . i can't . 
-1 hey arnold ! the movie could have been made 40 years ago , and parents' appreciation of it may depend on whether they consider that a good thing . 
-1 a series of escapades demonstrating the adage that what is good for the goose is also good for the gander , some of which occasionally amuses but none of which amounts to much of a story . 
+1 even if you don't understand what on earth is going on , this is a movie that will stimulate hours of post viewing discussion , if only to be reminded of who did what to whom and why . 
+1 as weber and weissman demonstrate with such insight and celebratory verve , the cockettes weren't as much about gender , sexual preference or political agitprop as they were simply a triumph of the indomitable human will to rebel , connect and create . 
-1 it should be interesting , it should be poignant , it turns out to be affected and boring . 
-1 feels too formulaic and too familiar to produce the transgressive thrills of early underground work . 
-1 fear dot com is more frustrating than a modem that disconnects every 10 seconds . 
-1 the idea of 49-year-old roberto benigni playing the wooden boy pinocchio is scary enough . the reality of the new live-action pinocchio he directed , cowrote and starred in borders on the grotesque . 
+1 this quiet , introspective and entertaining independent is worth seeking . 
-1 yet another self-consciously overwritten story about a rag-tag bunch of would-be characters that team up for a can't-miss heist -- only to have it all go wrong . 
-1 trapped presents a frightening and compelling 'what if ? ' scenario that will give most parents pause . . . . then , something terrible happens . 
+1 [barry] gives assassin a disquieting authority . 
-1 although barbershop boasts some of today's hottest and hippest acts from the world of television , music and stand-up comedy , this movie strangely enough has the outdated swagger of a shameless 70s blaxploitation shuck-and-jive sitcom . 
-1 the cinematic equivalent of patronizing a bar favored by pretentious , untalented artistes who enjoy moaning about their cruel fate . 
-1 sheridan is painfully bad , a fourth-rate jim carrey who doesn't understand the difference between dumb fun and just plain dumb . 
+1 a plethora of engaging diatribes on the meaning of 'home , ' delivered in grand passion by the members of the various households . 
-1 no , it's not nearly as good as any of its influences . 
-1 the lousy lead performances . . . keep the movie from ever reaching the comic heights it obviously desired . 
-1 the rules of attraction gets us too drunk on the party favors to sober us up with the transparent attempts at moralizing . 
-1 it's like an all-star salute to disney's cheesy commercialism . 
-1 an unpredictable blend of gal-pal smart talk , romantic comedy and dark tragedy that bites off considerably more than writer/director john mckay can swallow . 
+1 [schweiger is] talented and terribly charismatic , qualities essential to both movie stars and social anarchists . 
+1 the date movie that franz kafka would have made . 
+1 an undeniably gorgeous , terminally smitten document of a troubadour , his acolytes , and the triumph of his band . 
-1 one can only assume that the jury who bestowed star hoffman's brother gordy with the waldo salt screenwriting award at 2002's sundance festival were honoring an attempt to do something different over actually pulling it off
-1 the movie , while beautiful , feels labored , with a hint of the writing exercise about it . 
+1 just watch bettany strut his stuff . you'll know a star when you see one . 
-1 passably entertaining but also mechanical and joyless . 
-1 feels slight , as if it were an extended short , albeit one made by the smartest kids in class . 
+1 chilling in its objective portrait of dreary , lost twenty-first century america . 
+1 byler is too savvy a filmmaker to let this morph into a typical romantic triangle . instead , he focuses on the anguish that can develop when one mulls leaving the familiar to traverse uncharted ground . 
-1 by getting myself wrapped up in the visuals and eccentricities of many of the characters , i found myself confused when it came time to get to the heart of the movie . 
+1 highly irritating at first , mr . koury's passive technique eventually begins to yield some interesting results . 
-1 hip-hop rarely comes alive as its own fire-breathing entity in this picture . 
-1 beneath the uncanny , inevitable and seemingly shrewd facade of movie-biz farce . . . lies a plot cobbled together from largely flat and uncreative moments . 
-1 the first mistake , i suspect , is casting shatner as a legendary professor and kunis as a brilliant college student--where's pauly shore as the rocket scientist ? 
-1 the script becomes lifeless and falls apart like a cheap lawn chair . 
-1  . . . if you're just in the mood for a fun -- but bad -- movie , you might want to catch freaks as a matinee . 
-1 the star who helped give a spark to " chasing amy " and " changing lanes " falls flat as thinking man cia agent jack ryan in this summer's new action film , " the sum of all fears . " 
+1 as gory as the scenes of torture and self-mutilation may be , they are pitted against shimmering cinematography that lends the setting the ethereal beauty of an asian landscape painting . 
-1 i think it was plato who said , 'i think , therefore i know better than to rush to the theatre for this one . '
+1 few films have captured the chaos of an urban conflagration with such fury , and audience members will leave feeling as shaken as nesbitt's cooper looks when the bullets stop flying . 
+1 director claude chabrol has become the master of innuendo . it is not what you see , it is what you think you see . 
-1 a benign but forgettable sci-fi diversion . 
+1  " extreme ops " exceeds expectations . good fun , good action , good acting , good dialogue , good pace , good cinematography . 
+1 the comedy makes social commentary more palatable . 
+1 for almost the first two-thirds of martin scorsese's 168-minute gangs of new york , i was entranced . 
+1 this is a dark , gritty , sometimes funny little gem . 
+1 scherfig , the writer-director , has made a film so unabashedly hopeful that it actually makes the heart soar . yes , soar . 
+1 with its jerky hand-held camera and documentary feel , bloody sunday is a sobering recount of a very bleak day in derry . 
-1 lacks heart , depth and , most of all , purpose . 
+1 a cultural wildcard experience : wacky , different , unusual , even nutty . 
-1 a few energetic stunt sequences briefly enliven the film , but the wheezing terrorist subplot hasn't the stamina for the 100-minute running time , and the protagonists' bohemian boorishness mars the spirit of good clean fun . 
-1 philip k . dick must be turning in his grave , along with my stomach . 
-1 sorvino makes the princess seem smug and cartoonish , and the film only really comes alive when poor hermocrates and leontine pathetically compare notes about their budding amours . 
+1 it dares to be a little different , and that shading is what makes it worthwhile . 
-1 some of the computer animation is handsome , and various amusing sidekicks add much-needed levity to the otherwise bleak tale , but overall the film never rises above mediocrity . 
+1 collateral damage is trash , but it earns extra points by acting as if it weren't . 
+1 greg kinnear gives a mesmerizing performance as a full-fledged sex addict who is in complete denial about his obsessive behavior . 
+1 manages to accomplish what few sequels can -- it equals the original and in some ways even betters it . 
-1 as a rumor of angels reveals itself to be a sudsy tub of supernatural hokum , not even ms . redgrave's noblest efforts can redeem it from hopeless sentimentality . 
+1 for once , a movie does not proclaim the truth about two love-struck somebodies , but permits them time and space to convince us of that all on their own . 
+1 george lucas returns as a visionary with a tale full of nuance and character dimension . 
+1 with or without the sex , a wonderful tale of love and destiny , told well by a master storyteller
+1 watching beanie and his gang put together his slasher video from spare parts and borrowed materials is as much fun as it must have been for them to make it . 
-1 broomfield's style of journalism is hardly journalism at all , and even those with an avid interest in the subject will grow impatient . 
-1 too slow , too long and too little happens . 
-1 guilty of the worst sin of attributable to a movie like this : it's not scary in the slightest . 
-1 friday after next has the same problem that next friday did -- it's called where's chris tucker when you need him ? 
+1 lathan and diggs have considerable personal charm , and their screen rapport makes the old story seem new . 
-1 this is sandler running on empty , repeating what he's already done way too often . 
+1 fast-paced and wonderfully edited , the film is extremely thorough . 
-1 the director's many dodges and turns add up to little more than a screenful of gamesmanship that's low on both suspense and payoff . 
-1 like most of jaglom's films , some of it is honestly affecting , but more of it seems contrived and secondhand . 
-1 and people make fun of me for liking showgirls</> . 
+1 thoughtful , provocative and entertaining . 
+1 a good thriller . 
+1 it's both a necessary political work and a fascinating documentary . . . 
+1 painful , horrifying and oppressively tragic , this film should not be missed . 
+1 a subtle , humorous , illuminating study of politics , power and social mobility . 
+1  . . . a sour little movie at its core ; an exploration of the emptiness that underlay the relentless gaiety of the 1920's . . . the film's ending has a " what was it all for ? " feeling to it , but like the 1920's , the trip there is a great deal of fun . 
-1 roman polanski directs the pianist like a surgeon mends a broken heart ; very meticulously but without any passion . 
-1 [a] mess . 
-1 as vulgar as it is banal . 
+1 as hugh grant says repeatedly throughout the movie , 'lovely ! brilliant ! '
-1 the script is too mainstream and the psychology too textbook to intrigue . 
-1 big fat liar is just futile silliness looking to tap into the kiddie sensibilities . 
+1 sorvino is delightful in the central role . she nearly glows with enthusiasm , sensuality and a conniving wit . 
-1 true to its animatronic roots : . . . as stiff , ponderous and charmless as a mechanical apparatus . . . 'the country bears' should never have been brought out of hibernation . 
-1 nothing debases a concept comedy quite like the grinding of bad ideas , and showtime is crammed full of them . 
+1 a funny film . 
-1 too many improbabilities and rose-colored situations temper what could've been an impacting film . 
-1 the very simple story seems too simple and the working out of the plot almost arbitrary . 
-1 what could have been right at home as a nifty plot line in steven soderbergh's traffic fails to arrive at any satisfying destination . 
+1 contrived as this may sound , mr . rose's updating works surprisingly well . 
-1 this flat run at a hip-hop tootsie is so poorly paced you could fit all of pootie tang in between its punchlines . 
-1  in the end , white oleander isn't an adaptation of a novel . it's a flashy , star-splashed reduction . 
+1 what lifts the film high above run-of-the-filth gangster flicks is its refusal to recognise any of the signposts , as if discovering a way through to the bitter end without a map . 
+1 a movie that at its best doesn't just make the most out of its characters' flaws but insists on the virtue of imperfection . 
+1 as broad and cartoonish as the screenplay is , there is an accuracy of observation in the work of the director , frank novak , that keeps the film grounded in an undeniable social realism . 
-1 on a cutting room floor somewhere lies . . . footage that might have made no such thing a trenchant , ironic cultural satire instead of a frustrating misfire . 
-1 i doubt anyone will remember the picture by the time christmas really rolls around , but maybe it'll be on video by then . 
+1 quite simply , a joy to watch and--especially--to listen to . 
-1 guys say mean things and shoot a lot of bullets . some of the characters die and others don't , and the film pretends that those living have learned some sort of lesson , and , really , nobody in the viewing audience cares . 
+1 an honest , sensitive story from a vietnamese point of view . 
+1 a good piece of work more often than not . 
+1 ok arthouse . the power of this script , and the performances that come with it , is that the whole damned thing didn't get our moral hackles up . 
-1 here's a case of two actors who do everything humanly possible to create characters who are sweet and believable , and are defeated by a screenplay that forces them into bizarre , implausible behavior . 
-1 the cameo-packed , m : i-2-spoofing title sequence is the funniest 5 minutes to date in this spy comedy franchise . . . then mike myers shows up and ruins everything . 
-1 just one more collection of penis , breast and flatulence gags in search of a story . or a profit . or some damn thing . 
-1 i suspect this is the kind of production that would have been funnier if the director had released the outtakes theatrically and used the film as a bonus feature on the dvd . 
+1 laugh-out-loud lines , adorably ditsy but heartfelt performances , and sparkling , bittersweet dialogue that cuts to the chase of the modern girl's dilemma . 
+1 [fessenden] is much more into ambiguity and creating mood than he is for on screen thrills
-1 the film's few ideas are stretched to the point of evaporation ; the whole central section is one big chase that seems to have no goal and no urgency . it's just filler . 
-1 murder by numbers just doesn't add up . 
-1 [w]hile long on amiable monkeys and worthy environmentalism , jane goodall's wild chimpanzees is short on the thrills the oversize medium demands . 
+1 this is so de palma . if you love him , you'll like it . if you don't . . . well , skip to another review . 
-1 remember when bond had more glamour than clamor ? no more . 
-1 if high crimes were any more generic it would have a universal product code instead of a title . 
-1 the colorful masseur wastes its time on mood rather than riding with the inherent absurdity of ganesh's rise up the social ladder . 
-1 it would be great to see this turd squashed under a truck , preferably a semi . 
-1 kids don't mind crappy movies as much as adults , provided there's lots of cute animals and clumsy people . 'snow dogs' has both . 
+1  . . . mesmerizing , an eye-opening tour of modern beijing culture in a journey of rebellion , retreat into oblivion and return . 
-1 a slight and obvious effort , even for one whose target demographic is likely still in the single digits , age-wise . 
-1 the moviegoing equivalent of going to a dinner party and being forced to watch the host and hostess's home video of their baby's birth . 
+1 a masterpiece four years in the making . 
+1 a live-wire film that never loses its ability to shock and amaze . 
+1 a romantic comedy enriched by a sharp eye for manners and mores . 
+1 more romantic , more emotional and ultimately more satisfying than the teary-eyed original . 
-1 an " o bruin , where art thou ? " -style cross-country adventure . . . it has sporadic bursts of liveliness , some so-so slapstick and a few ear-pleasing songs on its soundtrack . 
+1 if you like peace , you'll like promises . 
-1 if you saw benigni's pinocchio at a public park , you'd grab your kids and run and then probably call the police . 
+1 disappointingly , the characters are too strange and dysfunctional , tom included , to ever get under the skin , but this is compensated in large part by the off-the-wall dialogue , visual playfulness and the outlandishness of the idea itself . 
-1 resembles a soft porn brian de palma pastiche . 
+1 it has the charm of the original american road movies , feasting on the gorgeous , ramshackle landscape of the filmmaker's motherland . 
-1 they threw loads of money at an idea that should've been so much more even if it was only made for teenage boys and wrestling fans . 
-1 not really bad so much as distasteful : we need kidnapping suspense dramas right now like we need doomsday thrillers . 
+1 its metaphors are opaque enough to avoid didacticism , and the film succeeds as an emotionally accessible , almost mystical work . 
-1 the director and her capable cast appear to be caught in a heady whirl of new age-inspired good intentions , but the spell they cast isn't the least bit mesmerizing . 
-1 its impressive images of crematorium chimney fires and stacks of dead bodies are undermined by the movie's presentation , which is way too stagy . 
+1 boisterous and daft documentary . 
-1 it's the humanizing stuff that will probably sink the film for anyone who doesn't think about percentages all day long . 
-1 if you think that jennifer lopez has shown poor judgment in planning to marry ben affleck , wait till you see maid in manhattan . 
+1 good movie . good actress . but if you expect light romantic comedy , good gosh , will you be shocked . 
-1 this extremely unfunny film clocks in at 80 minutes , but feels twice as long . 
-1 a disappointment for those who love alternate versions of the bard , particularly ones that involve deep fryers and hamburgers . 
-1 it smacks of purely commercial motivation , with no great love for the original . 
-1 a mess . the screenplay does too much meandering , norton has to recite bland police procedural details , fiennes wanders around in an attempt to seem weird and distanced , hopkins looks like a drag queen . 
-1 the only entertainment you'll derive from this choppy and sloppy affair will be from unintentional giggles  several of them . 
+1 in a summer of clones , harvard man is something rare and riveting : a wild ride that relies on more than special effects . 
-1 whole stretches of the film may be incomprehensible to moviegoers not already clad in basic black . 
+1 'film aficionados cannot help but love cinema paradiso , whether the original version or new director's cut . '
-1 definitely a crowd-pleaser , but then , so was the roman colosseum . 
-1 somewhere inside the mess that is world traveler , there is a mediocre movie trying to get out . 
-1 one of the most depressing movie-going experiences i can think of is to sit through about 90 minutes of a so-called 'comedy' and not laugh once . 
-1 there's a disturbing 'great white hope' undertone to the other side of heaven that subtly undermines its message of christian love and compassion . 
+1 though filmed partly in canada , paid in full has clever ways of capturing inner-city life during the reagan years . 
+1 life on the rez is no picnic : this picture shows you why . 
-1 writer-director stephen gaghan has made the near-fatal mistake of being what the english call 'too clever by half . '
-1 what's at stake in this film is nothing more than an obsolete , if irritating , notion of class . 
+1 a cutesy romantic tale with a twist . 
-1 put it somewhere between sling blade and south of heaven , west of hell in the pantheon of billy bob's body of work . 
+1 not for everyone , but for those with whom it will connect , it's a nice departure from standard moviegoing fare . 
+1 this 90-minute postmodern voyage was more diverting and thought-provoking than i'd expected it to be . 
-1 it's a boring movie about a boring man , made watchable by a bravura performance from a consummate actor incapable of being boring . 
+1 the way home is an ode to unconditional love and compassion garnered from years of seeing it all , a condition only the old are privy to , and . . . often misconstrued as weakness . 
+1 the son's room is a triumph of gentility that earns its moments of pathos . 
-1 chao was chen kaige's assistant for years in china . he has not learnt that storytelling is what the movies are about . 
+1 funny , sexy , devastating and incurably romantic . 
+1 heartwarming here relies less on forced air than on petter næss' delicate , clever direction . . . and a wonderful , imaginative script by axel hellstenius . 
+1 my thoughts were focused on the characters . that is a compliment to kuras and miller . if i had been thinking about the visual medium , they would have been doing something wrong . 
-1 sunk by way too much indulgence of scene-chewing , teeth-gnashing actorliness . 
+1 even when there are lulls , the emotions seem authentic , and the picture is so lovely toward the end . . . you almost don't notice the 129-minute running time . 
+1 ultimately , " mib ii " succeeds due to its rapid-fire delivery and enough inspired levity that it can't be dismissed as mindless . 
+1 clever , brutal and strangely soulful movie . 
-1 topkapi this is not . 
-1 it is that rare combination of bad writing , bad direction and bad acting -- the trifecta of badness . 
-1 cry havoc and let slip the dogs of cheese , indeed . 
-1 the spalding gray equivalent of a teen gross-out comedy . 
-1 sucking all the 'classic' out of robert louis stevenson's treasure island and filling the void with sci-fi video game graphics and disney-fied adolescent angst . . . 
+1 film can't quite maintain its initial momentum , but remains sporadically funny throughout . 
-1 davis . . . is so enamored of her own creation that she can't see how insufferable the character is . 
+1 he's the scariest guy you'll see all summer . 
-1 less-than-compelling documentary of a yiddish theater clan . 
-1 often silly  and gross  but it's rarely as moronic as some campus gross-out films . 
-1 it desperately wants to be a wacky , screwball comedy , but the most screwy thing here is how so many talented people were convinced to waste their time . 
+1 finally , the french-produced " read my lips " is a movie that understands characters must come first . 
+1 an ambitious and moving but bleak film . 
-1 the criticism never rises above easy , cynical potshots at morally bankrupt characters . . . 
-1 here , common sense flies out the window , along with the hail of bullets , none of which ever seem to hit sascha . 
+1 it is a film that will have people walking out halfway through , will encourage others to stand up and applaud , and will , undoubtedly , leave both camps engaged in a ferocious debate for years to come . 
+1 the history is fascinating ; the action is dazzling . they just don't work in concert . 
-1 to call this film a lump of coal would only be to flatter it . 
-1 sit through this one , and you won't need a magic watch to stop time ; your dvd player will do it for you . 
-1 hey everybody , wanna watch a movie in which a guy dressed as a children's party clown gets violently gang-raped ? i didn't think so . 
+1 handsome and sophisticated approach to the workplace romantic comedy . 
+1 emerges as something rare , an issue movie that's so honest and keenly observed that it doesn't feel like one . 
-1 even legends like alfred hitchcock and john huston occasionally directed trifles . . . so it's no surprise to see a world-class filmmaker like zhang yimou behind the camera for a yarn that's ultimately rather inconsequential . 
+1 it's an often-cute film but either needs more substance to fill the time or some judicious editing . 
+1 fubar is very funny , but not always in a laugh-out-loud way . 
+1 as comedic spotlights go , notorious c . h . o . hits all the verbal marks it should . 
+1 smith's approach is never to tease , except gently and in that way that makes us consider our own eccentricities and how they are expressed through our homes . 
+1 a sad , superior human comedy played out on the back roads of life . 
+1 novak manages to capture a cruelly hilarious vein of black comedy in the situation with his cast of non-actors and a gritty , no-budget approach . 
-1 whatever eyre's failings as a dramatist , he deserves credit for bringing audiences into this hard and bitter place . 
-1 this is a film living far too much in its own head . 
-1 clayburgh and tambor are charming performers ; neither of them deserves eric schaeffer . 
+1 jacquot has filmed the opera exactly as the libretto directs , ideally capturing the opera's drama and lyricism . 
-1 despite a performance of sustained intelligence from stanford and another of subtle humour from bebe neuwirth , as an older woman who seduces oscar , the film founders on its lack of empathy for the social milieu - rich new york intelligentsia - and its off
-1 a tv episode inflated past its natural length . 
-1 there's something not entirely convincing about the quiet american . and that holds true for both the movie and the title character played by brendan fraser . 
+1 a movie that reminds us of just how exciting and satisfying the fantasy cinema can be when it's approached with imagination and flair . 
-1 nothing about the film -- with the possible exception of elizabeth hurley's breasts -- is authentic . 
+1 perhaps the grossest movie ever made . funny , though . 
+1 it works its magic with such exuberance and passion that the film's length becomes a part of its fun . 
+1 the wild thornberrys movie has all the sibling rivalry and general family chaos to which anyone can relate . 
-1 time literally stops on a dime in the tries-so-hard-to-be-cool " clockstoppers , " but that doesn't mean it still won't feel like the longest 90 minutes of your movie-going life . 
-1 like the excruciating end of days , collateral damage presents schwarzenegger as a tragic figure , but sympathy really belongs with any viewer forced to watch him try out so many complicated facial expressions . 
-1 ill-considered , unholy hokum . 
+1 chris columbus' sequel is faster , livelier and a good deal funnier than his original . 
-1 deep down , i realized the harsh reality of my situation : i would leave the theater with a lower i . q . than when i had entered . 
-1 denzel washington's efforts are sunk by all the sanctimony . 
+1 a polished and vastly entertaining caper film that puts the sting back into the con . 
+1 the pain , loneliness and insecurity of the screenwriting process are vividly and painfully brought to slovenly life in this self-deprecating , biting and witty feature written by charlie kaufman and his twin brother , donald , and directed by spike jonze . 
-1 a pleasant and engaging enough sit , but in trying to have the best of both worlds it ends up falling short as a whole . 
-1 fails as a dystopian movie , as a retooling of fahrenheit 451 , and even as a rip-off of the matrix . 
+1 thumbs up to paxton for not falling into the hollywood trap and making a vanity project with nothing new to offer . 
-1 i'm afraid you won't get through this frankly fantastical by-the-numbers b-flick with just a suspension of disbelief . rather , you'll have to wrestle disbelief to the ground and then apply the chloroform-soaked handkerchief . 
+1 an engaging , formulaic sports drama that carries a charge of genuine excitement . 
+1 a real story about real people living their lives concerned about the future of an elderly , mentally handicapped family member . 
+1 the film has the uncanny ability to right itself precisely when you think it's in danger of going wrong . 
-1 what will , most likely , turn out to be the most repellent movie of 2002 . 
-1 debut effort by " project greenlight " winner is sappy and amateurish . 
-1 reggio falls victim to relying on the very digital technology that he fervently scorns , creating a meandering , inarticulate and ultimately disappointing film . 
+1 the film starts out as competent but unremarkable . . . and gradually grows into something of considerable power . 
-1 clumsy , obvious , preposterous , the movie will likely set the cause of woman warriors back decades . 
+1 ou've got to love a disney pic with as little cleavage as this one has , and a heroine as feisty and principled as jane . 
-1 isn't as sharp as the original . . . despite some visual virtues , 'blade ii' just doesn't cut it . 
+1 it's the kind of pigeonhole-resisting romp that hollywood too rarely provides . 
+1 a delightful romantic comedy with plenty of bite . it's far from a frothy piece , and the characters are complex , laden with plenty of baggage and tinged with tragic undertones . 
+1 an unflinching look at the world's dispossessed . 
-1 it's splash without the jokes . 
-1 who , exactly , is fighting whom here ? ah , yes , that would be me : fighting off the urge to doze . 
-1 it's so mediocre , despite the dynamic duo on the marquee , that we just can't get no satisfaction . 
-1 it has the air of a surprisingly juvenile lark , a pop-influenced prank whose charms are immediately apparent and wear thin with repetition . 
-1 i watched the brainless insanity of no such thing with mounting disbelief . 
+1 like the original , this version is raised a few notches above kiddie fantasy pablum by allen's astringent wit . 
-1 [sen's] soap opera-ish approach undermines his good intentions . 
-1 although bright , well-acted and thought-provoking , tuck everlasting suffers from a laconic pace and a lack of traditional action . 
-1 in his role of observer of the scene , lawrence sounds whiny and defensive , as if his life-altering experiences made him bitter and less mature . 
-1 tadpole is emblematic of the witless ageism afflicting films : young is cool , and too young is too cool . 
+1 s1m0ne's satire is not subtle , but it is effective . it's a quirky , off-beat project . . . . 
+1 thanks to ice cube , benjamins feels an awful lot like friday in miami . 
+1 it's an experience in understanding a unique culture that is presented with universal appeal . 
+1 the film belongs to the marvelous verdu , a sexy slip of an earth mother who mourns her tragedies in private and embraces life in public
+1 absorbing character study by andré turpin . 
+1 other than the slightly flawed ( and fairly unbelievable ) finale , everything else is top shelf . 
+1 what saves this deeply affecting film from being merely a collection of wrenching cases is corcuera's attention to detail . 
+1 all three women deliver remarkable performances . 
+1 a charming yet poignant tale of the irrevocable ties that bind . 
+1 it will break your heart many times over . 
-1  . . . routine , harmless diversion and little else . 
-1 its generic villains lack any intrigue ( other than their funny accents ) and the action scenes are poorly delivered . 
+1 it has that rare quality of being able to creep the living hell out of you . . . 
-1 anyone who suffers through this film deserves , at the very least , a big box of consolation candy . 
-1 spousal abuse is a major problem in contemporary society , but the film reduces this domestic tragedy to florid melodrama . 
-1  . . . this movie has a glossy coat of action movie excess while remaining heartless at its core . 
-1 like many such biographical melodramas , it suffers from the awkwardness that results from adhering to the messiness of true stories . 
+1 others , more attuned to the anarchist maxim that 'the urge to destroy is also a creative urge' , or more willing to see with their own eyes , will find morrison's iconoclastic uses of technology to be liberating . 
-1 although no pastry is violated , this nasty comedy pokes fun at the same easy targets as other rowdy raunch-fests -- farts , boobs , unmentionables -- without much success . 
-1 one of the more irritating cartoons you will see this , or any , year . 
-1 a " home alone " film that is staged like " rosemary's baby , " but is not as well-conceived as either of those films . 
+1 that rare film whose real-life basis is , in fact , so interesting that no embellishment is needed . 
-1 just a string of stale gags , with no good inside dope , and no particular bite . 
+1 it's jagger's bone-dry , mournfully brittle delivery that gives the film its bittersweet bite . 
-1 a thriller without a lot of thrills . 
+1 the film delivers what it promises : a look at the " wild ride " that ensues when brash young men set out to conquer the online world with laptops , cell phones and sketchy business plans . 
+1 occasionally melodramatic , it's also extremely effective . 
-1 the film has the thrown-together feel of a summer-camp talent show : hastily written , underrehearsed , arbitrarily plotted and filled with crude humor and vulgar innuendo . 
-1 well-shot but badly written tale set in a future ravaged by dragons . 
-1 a rather average action film that benefits from several funny moments supplied by epps . 
-1 the tug-of-war at the core of beijing bicycle becomes weighed down with agonizing contrivances , overheated pathos and long , wistful gazes . 
-1 i still can't relate to stuart : he's a mouse , for cryin' out loud , and all he does is milk it with despondent eyes and whine that nobody treats him human enough . 
-1 another useless recycling of a brutal mid-'70s american sports movie . 
-1 things really get weird , though not particularly scary : the movie is all portent and no content . 
+1 there's so much to look at in metropolis you hate to tear your eyes away from the images long enough to read the subtitles . 
-1 somewhere in the middle , the film compels , as demme experiments he harvests a few movie moment gems , but the field of roughage dominates . 
-1 it wouldn't matter so much that this arrogant richard pryor wannabe's routine is offensive , puerile and unimaginatively foul-mouthed if it was at least funny . 
+1 an incredibly thoughtful , deeply meditative picture that neatly and effectively captures the debilitating grief felt in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks . 
-1 the fact that the 'best part' of the movie comes from a 60-second homage to one of demme's good films doesn't bode well for the rest of it . 
-1 the film desperately sinks further and further into comedy futility . 
+1 for all its plot twists , and some of them verge on the bizarre as the film winds down , blood work is a strong , character-oriented piece . 
+1 the rare imax movie that you'll wish was longer than an hour . 
+1 may be far from the best of the series , but it's assured , wonderfully respectful of its past and thrilling enough to make it abundantly clear that this movie phenomenon has once again reinvented itself for a new generation . 
-1 that zhang would make such a strainingly cute film -- with a blind orphan at its center , no less -- indicates where his ambitions have wandered . 
-1 a really good premise is frittered away in middle-of-the-road blandness . 
+1 a blessed gift to film geeks and historians . if the '70's were your idea of a good time at the movies , this will make you very happy . 
+1 we need [moore's] noisy , cocky energy , his passion and class consciousness ; we need his shticks , we need his stones . 
-1 at least it's a fairly impressive debut from the director , charles stone iii . 
+1 if i have to choose between gorgeous animation and a lame story ( like , say , treasure planet ) or so-so animation and an exciting , clever story with a batch of appealing characters , i'll take the latter every time . 
+1 a real movie , about real people , that gives us a rare glimpse into a culture most of us don't know . 
-1 has its moments -- and almost as many subplots . 
-1 a distinctly minor effort that will be seen to better advantage on cable , especially considering its barely feature-length running time of one hour . 
-1 writhing under dialogue like 'you're from two different worlds' and 'tonight the maid is a lie and this , this is who you are , ' this schlock-filled fairy tale hits new depths of unoriginality and predictability . 
-1 unfunny comedy with a lot of static set ups , not much camera movement , and most of the scenes take place indoors in formal settings with motionless characters . 
+1 despite what anyone believes about the goal of its makers , the show . . . represents a spectacular piece of theater , and there's no denying the talent of the creative forces behind it . 
-1 when one hears harry shearer is going to make his debut as a film director , one would hope for the best
+1 opening with some contrived banter , cliches and some loose ends , the screenplay only comes into its own in the second half . 
+1 to the film's credit , the acting is fresh and unselfconscious , and munch is a marvel of reality versus sappy sentiment . 
-1 ecks this one off your must-see list . 
+1 people cinema at its finest . 
+1 a film that's flawed and brilliant in equal measure . 
-1 witless and utterly pointless . 
+1 works because reno doesn't become smug or sanctimonious towards the audience . 
+1 ultimate x is a ride , basically the kind of greatest-hits reel that might come with a subscription to espn the magazine . 
-1 cedar somewhat defuses this provocative theme by submerging it in a hoary love triangle . 
+1 rich in atmosphere of the post-war art world , it manages to instruct without reeking of research library dust . 
+1 despite the film's bizarre developments , hoffman keeps us riveted with every painful nuance , unexpected flashes of dark comedy and the character's gripping humanity . 
+1 you emerge dazed , confused as to whether you've seen pornography or documentary . 
+1 a comic gem with some serious sparkles . 
-1 the filmmaker ascends , literally , to the olympus of the art world , but he would have done well to end this flawed , dazzling series with the raising of something other than his own cremaster . 
-1 moretti plays giovanni , a psychiatrist who predictably finds it difficult to sustain interest in his profession after the family tragedy . too predictably , in fact . 
+1 plummer steals the show without resorting to camp as nicholas' wounded and wounding uncle ralph . it's a great performance and a reminder of dickens' grandeur . 
-1 a tv style murder mystery with a few big screen moments ( including one that seems to be made for a different film altogether ) . 
-1 it tells its story in a flat manner and leaves you with the impression that you should have gotten more out of it than you did . 
-1 it's all very cute , though not terribly funny if you're more than six years old . 
+1 together , tok and o orchestrate a buoyant , darkly funny dance of death . in the process , they demonstrate that there's still a lot of life in hong kong cinema . 
+1 campbell scott finds the ideal outlet for his flick-knife diction in the role of roger swanson . 
-1 despite hoffman's best efforts , wilson remains a silent , lumpish cipher ; his encounters reveal nothing about who he is or who he was before . 
+1 may be more genial than ingenious , but it gets the job done . 
+1 a minor work yet there's no denying the potency of miller's strange , fleeting brew of hopeful perseverance and hopeless closure . 
+1 earns its laughs from stock redneck 'types' and from the many , many moments when we recognize even without the elizabethan prose , the play behind the thing . 
-1 it's rare that a movie can be as intelligent as this one is in every regard except its storyline ; everything that's good is ultimately scuttled by a plot that's just too boring and obvious . 
+1 by not averting his eyes , solondz forces us to consider the unthinkable , the unacceptable , the unmentionable . 
+1 the vitality of the actors keeps the intensity of the film high , even as the strafings blend together . 
-1 a movie that's about as overbearing and over-the-top as the family it depicts . 
-1 this film was made to get laughs from the slowest person in the audience -- just pure slapstick with lots of inane , inoffensive screaming and exaggerated facial expressions . 
+1 meant for star wars fans . it is there to give them a good time . 
+1 it may be about drug dealers , kidnapping , and unsavory folks , but the tone and pacing are shockingly intimate . 
-1 the movie takes itself too seriously and , as a result , it makes for only intermittent fun . 
-1 when a set of pre-shooting guidelines a director came up with for his actors turns out to be cleverer , better written and of considerable more interest than the finished film , that's a bad sign . a very bad sign . 
+1 you won't like roger , but you will quickly recognize him . and that's a big part of why we go to the movies . 
+1 a pleasing , often-funny comedy . 
-1 mark me down as a non-believer in werewolf films that are not serious and rely on stupidity as a substitute for humor . 
-1 alex nohe's documentary plays like a travelogue for what mostly resembles a real-life , big-budget nc-17 version of tank girl . 
-1 so much about the film is loopy and ludicrous . . . that it could have been a hoot in a bad-movie way if the laborious pacing and endless exposition had been tightened . 
+1 like mike isn't interested in recycling old cliches . it wants to tweak them with a taste of tangy new humor . 
-1 festers in just such a dungpile that you'd swear you were watching monkeys flinging their feces at you . 
+1 it makes you believe the cast and crew thoroughly enjoyed themselves and believed in their small-budget film . 
+1 an engaging criminal romp that will have viewers guessing just who's being conned right up to the finale . 
-1 my response to the film is best described as lukewarm . maybe i found the proceedings a little bit too conventional . 
-1 some like it hot on the hardwood proves once again that a man in drag is not in and of himself funny . 
+1 connoisseurs of chinese film will be pleased to discover that tian's meticulous talent has not withered during his enforced hiatus . 
+1 a fast , funny , highly enjoyable movie . 
-1 a valueless kiddie paean to pro basketball underwritten by the nba . 
-1 it's not thirsty , consuming passion which drives this movie . no , it's the repetition of said behavior , and so children of the century is more mindless love than mad , more grating and boring than anything else . 
+1 whether you like rap music or loathe it , you can't deny either the tragic loss of two young men in the prime of their talent or the power of this movie . 
+1 plunges you into a reality that is , more often then not , difficult and sad , and then , without sentimentalizing it or denying its brutality , transforms that reality into a lyrical and celebratory vision . 
+1 a terrific date movie , whatever your orientation . 
+1 anyone who ever fantasized about space travel but can't afford the $20 million ticket to ride a russian rocket should catch this imax offering . 
-1 the leads we are given here are simply too bland to be interesting . 
+1 after making several adaptations of other writers' work , armenian-canadian director atom egoyan broached an original treatment of a deeply personal subject . 
-1 if i spy were funny ( enough ) or exciting ( enough ) then it would be fairly simple to forgive the financial extortion it's trying to reap from the moviegoing public . 
+1 one of the film's most effective aspects is its tchaikovsky soundtrack of neurasthenic regret . 
+1  " spider-man is better than any summer blockbuster we had to endure last summer , and hopefully , sets the tone for a summer of good stuff . if you're a comic fan , you can't miss it . if you're not , you'll still have a good time . " 
+1 do we really need a 77-minute film to tell us exactly why a romantic relationship between a 15-year-old boy and a 40-year-old woman doesn't work ? 
+1 in his u . s . debut , mr . schnitzler proves himself a deft pace master and stylist . 
-1 there are a few laughs and clever sight gags scattered about , but not enough to make this anything more than another big-budget bust . 
-1 less funny than it should be and less funny than it thinks it is . 
-1 a meatballs for the bare-midriff generation . 
-1 [t]oo many of these gross out scenes . . . 
-1 blood work is laughable in the solemnity with which it tries to pump life into overworked elements from eastwood's dirty harry period . 
+1 it would be interesting to hear from the other side , but in talk to her , the women are down for the count . 
-1 did no one on the set have a sense of humor , or did they not have the nerve to speak up ? 
-1 nicks and steinberg match their own creations for pure venality -- that's giving it the old college try . 
-1 a lousy movie that's not merely unwatchable , but also unlistenable . 
-1 the best that can be said about the work here of scottish director ritchie . . . is that he obviously doesn't have his heart in it . 
-1 the problems of the people in love in the time of money are hardly specific to their era . they just have problems , which are neither original nor are presented in convincing way . 
-1 a well made indieflick in need of some trims and a more chemistry between its stars . 
+1 it may seem long at 110 minutes if you're not a fan , because it includes segments of 12 songs at a reunion concert . 
+1 lovingly photographed in the manner of a golden book sprung to life , stuart little 2 manages sweetness largely without stickiness . 
+1 the values that have held the enterprise crew together through previous adventures and perils do so again-courage , self-sacrifice and patience under pressure . 
-1 just as the lousy tarantino imitations have subsided , here comes the first lousy guy ritchie imitation . 
+1 a fanciful drama about napoleon's last years and his surprising discovery of love and humility . 
+1 it's a treat watching shaw , a british stage icon , melting under the heat of phocion's attentions . 
-1 nothing plot-wise is worth e-mailing home about . 
+1 a moving , if uneven , success . 
+1 clint eastwood's blood work is a lot like a well-made pb& j sandwich : familiar , fairly uneventful and boasting no real surprises  but still quite tasty and inviting all the same . 
-1 watching the film is like reading a times portrait of grief that keeps shifting focus to the journalist who wrote it . 
+1  " austin powers in goldmember " has the right stuff for silly summer entertainment and has enough laughs to sustain interest to the end . 
+1 aside from rohmer's bold choices regarding point of view , the lady and the duke represents the filmmaker's lifelong concern with formalist experimentation in cinematic art . 
-1 it's one of those baseball pictures where the hero is stoic , the wife is patient , the kids are as cute as all get-out and the odds against success are long enough to intimidate , but short enough to make a dream seem possible . 
+1 you might want to take a reality check before you pay the full ticket price to see " simone , " and consider a dvd rental instead . 
+1 a sloppy , amusing comedy that proceeds from a stunningly unoriginal premise . 
+1 grown-up quibbles are beside the point here . the little girls understand , and mccracken knows that's all that matters . 
+1 it's an ambitious film , and as with all ambitious films , it has some problems . but on the whole , you're gonna like this movie . 
+1 this is a very funny , heartwarming film . it has fun with the quirks of family life , but it also treats the subject with fondness and respect . 
+1 nicole holofcener's lovely and amazing , from her own screenplay , jumps to the head of the class of women's films that manage to avoid the ghetto of sentimental chick-flicks by treating female follies with a satirical style . 
+1 conceptually brilliant . . . plays like a living-room war of the worlds , gaining most of its unsettling force from the suggested and the unknown . 
+1 may lack the pungent bite of its title , but it's an enjoyable trifle nonetheless . 
-1 putting the primitive murderer inside a high-tech space station unleashes a pandora's box of special effects that run the gamut from cheesy to cheesier to cheesiest . 
-1 director tom dey demonstrated a knack for mixing action and idiosyncratic humor in his charming 2000 debut shanghai noon , but showtime's uninspired send-up of tv cop show cliches mostly leaves him shooting blanks . 
-1 it briefly flirts with player masochism , but the point of real interest - audience sadism -- is evaded completely . 
+1 foster breathes life into a roll that could have otherwise been bland and run of the mill . 
+1 it has the ability to offend and put off everyone , but it holds you with its outrageousness . 
+1 dogtown and z-boys more than exposes the roots of the skateboarding boom that would become " the punk kids' revolution . " 
+1 director charles stone iii applies more detail to the film's music than to the story line ; what's best about drumline is its energy . 
+1 whatever heartwarming scene the impressively discreet filmmakers may have expected to record with their mini dv , they show a remarkable ability to document both sides of this emotional car-wreck . 
+1 offers much to enjoy . . . and a lot to mull over in terms of love , loyalty and the nature of staying friends . 
+1 the director , steven shainberg , has succeeded by focusing intently on his characters , making them quirky individuals rather than figures of fun . 
-1 gibney and jarecki just want to string the bastard up . 
+1 none of this is meaningful or memorable , but frosting isn't , either , and you wouldn't turn down a big bowl of that , would you ? 
+1 a stirring , funny and finally transporting re-imagining of beauty and the beast and 1930s horror films
+1 a timely look back at civil disobedience , anti-war movements and the power of strong voices . 
+1 brave and sweetly rendered love story . 
-1 too timid to bring a sense of closure to an ugly chapter of the twentieth century . 
+1 the story wraps back around on itself in the kind of elegant symmetry that's rare in film today , but be warned : it's a slow slog to get there . 
-1 'linklater fans , or pretentious types who want to appear avant-garde will suck up to this project . . . '
+1 it's sweet , funny , charming , and completely delightful . 
+1 there's no conversion effort , much of the writing is genuinely witty and both stars are appealing enough to probably have a good shot at a hollywood career , if they want one . 
+1 huppert and girardot give performances of exceptional honesty . 
-1 did the film inform and educate me ? yes . did it move me to care about what happened in 1915 armenia ? no . and that is where ararat went astray . 
+1 the filmmakers want nothing else than to show us a good time , and in their cheap , b movie way , they succeed . 
-1 a predictable , manipulative stinker . the story passes time until it's time for an absurd finale of twisted metal , fireballs and revenge . 
+1 this is a very ambitious project for a fairly inexperienced filmmaker , but good actors , good poetry and good music help sustain it . 
+1 what's most refreshing about real women have curves is its unforced comedy-drama and its relaxed , natural-seeming actors . 
+1 an intriguing look at the french film industry during the german occupation ; its most delightful moments come when various characters express their quirky inner selves . 
+1 the film is full of charm . 
-1 a minor picture with a major identity crisis -- it's sort of true and it's sort of bogus and it's ho-hum all the way through . 
-1 the adventures of pluto nash is a whole lot of nada . 
-1 shadyac , who belongs with the damned for perpetrating patch adams , trots out every ghost trick from the sixth sense to the mothman prophecies . 
+1 as teen movies go , " orange county " is a refreshing change
-1 it's both sitcomishly predictable and cloying in its attempts to be poignant . 
-1 if you enjoy being rewarded by a script that assumes you aren't very bright , then blood work is for you . 
+1 this is one of those war movies that focuses on human interaction rather than battle and action sequences . . . and it's all the stronger because of it . 
+1 a compelling story of musical passion against governmental odds . 
-1 stay away . far away . 
+1 phillip noyce and all of his actors -- as well as his cinematographer , christopher doyle -- understand the delicate forcefulness of greene's prose , and it's there on the screen in their version of the quiet american . 
-1 blue crush follows the formula , but throws in too many conflicts to keep the story compelling . 
-1 the kind of movie that leaves vague impressions and a nasty aftertaste but little clear memory of its operational mechanics . 
+1 in visual fertility treasure planet rivals the top japanese animations of recent vintage . 
+1 a teasing drama whose relentless good-deed/bad-deed reversals are just interesting enough to make a sinner like me pray for an even more interesting , less symmetrical , less obviously cross-shaped creation . 
-1 i admire it and yet cannot recommend it , because it overstays its natural running time . 
-1 no matter how you slice it , mark wahlberg and thandie newton are not hepburn and grant , two cinematic icons with chemistry galore . 
-1 the actors don't inhabit their roles -- they're trapped by them , forced to change behavior in bizarre unjustified fashion and spout dialog that consists mostly of platitudes . 
+1 a refreshingly authentic coming-of-age tale . 
+1 it's a charming and often affecting journey . 
+1 a true-blue delight . 
-1 it's sincere to a fault , but , unfortunately , not very compelling or much fun . 
+1 together [time out and human resources] establish mr . cantet as france's foremost cinematic poet of the workplace . 
+1 we do get the distinct impression that this franchise is drawing to a close . 
-1 the film is old-fashioned , occasionally charming and as subtle as boldface . 
-1 despite slick production values and director roger michell's tick-tock pacing , the final effect is like having two guys yelling in your face for two hours . 
-1 unfortunately , one hour photo lives down to its title . thanks largely to williams , all the interesting developments are processed in 60 minutes -- the rest is just an overexposed waste of film . 
-1 a well-made but emotionally scattered film whose hero gives his heart only to the dog . 
-1 utter mush . . . conceited pap . 
-1 it's best to avoid imprisonment with the dull , nerdy folks that inhabit cherish . 
+1 the far future may be awesome to consider , but from period detail to matters of the heart , this film is most transporting when it stays put in the past . 
-1 heavy-handed exercise in time-vaulting literary pretension . 
+1 a charmer from belgium . 
+1 kinnear and dafoe give what may be the performances of their careers . 
-1 [t]here's only so much anyone can do with a florid , overplotted , anne rice rock 'n' roll vampire novel before the built-in silliness of the whole affair defeats them . 
-1 one long string of cliches . 
+1 gaunt , silver-haired and leonine , [harris] brings a tragic dimension and savage full-bodied wit and cunning to the aging sandeman . 
-1 [the kid's] just too bratty for sympathy , and as the film grows to its finale , his little changes ring hollow . 
+1 just what makes us happy , anyway ? 
+1 a bittersweet contemporary comedy about benevolent deception , which , while it may not rival the filmmaker's period pieces , is still very much worth seeing . 
+1 while it has definite weaknesses -- like a rather unbelievable love interest and a meandering ending -- this '60s caper film is a riveting , brisk delight . 
+1 denis forges out of the theories of class- based rage and sisterly obsession a razor-sided tuning fork that rings with cultural , sexual and social discord . 
-1 the movie is about as humorous as watching your favorite pet get buried alive . 
-1 less than fresh . 
-1 suffers from over-familiarity since hit-hungry british filmmakers have strip-mined the monty formula mercilessly since 1997 . 
-1 nicks , seemingly uncertain what's going to make people laugh , runs the gamut from stale parody to raunchy sex gags to formula romantic comedy . 
-1 melanie eventually slugs the yankee . too bad the former murphy brown doesn't pop reese back . 
+1 the culmination of everyone's efforts is given life when a selection appears in its final form [in " last dance " ] . 
-1 this follow-up seems so similar to the 1953 disney classic that it makes one long for a geriatric peter . 
-1 some fine acting , but ultimately a movie with no reason for being . 
-1 a big , loud , bang-the-drum bore . 
-1 has all the hallmarks of a movie designed strictly for children's home video , a market so insatiable it absorbs all manner of lame entertainment , as long as 3-year-olds find it diverting . 
-1 paul bettany is good at being the ultra-violent gangster wannabe , but the movie is certainly not number 1 . 
+1 it's a feel-good movie about which you can actually feel good . 
+1 challenging , intermittently engrossing and unflaggingly creative . but it's too long and too convoluted and it ends in a muddle . 
+1 it's a smartly directed , grown-up film of ideas . 
+1 a feel-good picture in the best sense of the term . 
+1  . . . does such a fine job of engulfing you in its world and allying you with its characters' choices , good and ill , that its shortcomings are remembered only as an afterthought . 
-1 i guess it just goes to show that if you give a filmmaker an unlimited amount of phony blood , nothing good can happen . 
+1 the leanest and meanest of solondz's misanthropic comedies . 
-1 in my own very humble opinion , in praise of love lacks even the most fragmented charms i have found in almost all of his previous works . 
+1 a fascinating glimpse into an insular world that gives the lie to many clichés and showcases a group of dedicated artists . 
+1 director paul cox's unorthodox , abstract approach to visualizing nijinsky's diaries is both stimulating and demanding . 
+1 scotland looks wonderful , the fans are often funny fanatics , the showdown sure beats a bad day of golf . 
+1 an uncluttered , resonant gem that relays its universal points without lectures or confrontations . 
+1 moretti . . . is the rare common-man artist who's wise enough to recognize that there are few things in this world more complex -- and , as it turns out , more fragile -- than happiness . 
+1 you can take the grandkids or the grandparents and never worry about anyone being bored . . . audience is a sea of constant smiles and frequent laughter . 
-1 it is too bad that this likable movie isn't more accomplished . the actors try hard but come off too amateurish and awkward . 
+1 it helps that lil bow wow . . . tones down his pint-sized gangsta act to play someone who resembles a real kid . 
+1 every dance becomes about seduction , where backstabbing and betrayals are celebrated , and sex is currency . 
+1 'enigma' is the kind of engaging historical drama that hollywood appears to have given up on in favor of sentimental war movies in the vein of 'we were soldiers . '
+1 the film presents visceral and dangerously honest revelations about the men and machines behind the curtains of our planet . 
-1 the director's twitchy sketchbook style and adroit perspective shifts grow wearisome amid leaden pacing and indifferent craftsmanship ( most notably wretched sound design ) . 
+1 like a tarantino movie with heart , alias betty is richly detailed , deftly executed and utterly absorbing . 
-1 the beautiful , unusual music is this film's chief draw , but its dreaminess may lull you to sleep . 
+1 a solid and refined piece of moviemaking imbued with passion and attitude . 
-1 let's cut to the consumer-advice bottom line : stay home . 
+1 this is one of the most visually stunning and thematically moving epics in recent memory , and in spite of numerous minor flaws , scorsese's best in more than a decade . 
+1 it is a happy , heady jumble of thought and storytelling , an insane comic undertaking that ultimately coheres into a sane and breathtakingly creative film . 
+1 almost every scene in this film is a gem that could stand alone , a perfectly realized observation of mood , behavior and intent . 
+1 the concert footage is stirring , the recording sessions are intriguing , and -- on the way to striking a blow for artistic integrity -- this quality band may pick up new admirers . 
+1 cuts right through the b . s . giving a big middle-fingered " shut up " to those who talk up what is nothing more than two guys beating the hell outta one another . 
-1 the plot grinds on with yawn-provoking dullness . 
+1 the powerpuff girls arrive on the big screen with their super-powers , their super-simple animation and their super-dooper-adorability intact . 
-1 a bold ( and lovely ) experiment that will almost certainly bore most audiences into their own brightly colored dreams . 
-1 absurdities and clichés accumulate like lint in a fat man's navel . 
+1 transforms one of [shakespeare's] deepest tragedies into a smart new comedy . 
-1 a relatively effective little potboiler until its absurd , contrived , overblown , and entirely implausible finale . 
+1 a quietly reflective and melancholy new zealand film about an eventful summer in a 13-year-old girl's life . 
-1 in trying to be daring and original , it comes off as only occasionally satirical and never fresh . 
+1 it's soulful and unslick , and that's apparently just what [aniston] has always needed to grow into a movie career . 
+1 you've already seen city by the sea under a variety of titles , but it's worth yet another visit . 
+1 noyce films it more as a shocking history lesson than as drama . 
-1 humorless , self-conscious art drivel , made without a glimmer of intelligence or invention . 
-1 the film falls short on tension , eloquence , spiritual challenge -- things that have made the original new testament stories so compelling for 20 centuries . 
+1 takes a fresh and absorbing look at a figure whose legacy had begun to bronze . 
-1 slow , silly and unintentionally hilarious . 
+1 intriguing and downright intoxicating . 
-1 the art direction is often exquisite , and the anthropomorphic animal characters are beautifully realized through clever makeup design , leaving one to hope that the eventual dvd release will offer subtitles and the original italian-language soundtrack . 
-1 the problem with all of this : it's not really funny . 
-1 an uneasy mix of run-of-the-mill raunchy humor and seemingly sincere personal reflection . 
+1 this rush to profits has created a predictably efficient piece of business notable largely for its overwhelming creepiness , for an eagerness to create images you wish you hadn't seen , which , in this day and age , is of course the point . 
-1 a painfully leaden film destined for pre-dawn cable television slots . 
-1 while super troopers is above academy standards , its quintet of writers could still use some more schooling . 
-1 possibly the most irresponsible picture ever released by a major film studio . 
+1 contrasting the original ringu with the current americanized adaptation is akin to comparing the evil dead with evil dead ii
+1 it's not just a feel-good movie , it's a feel movie . you feel good , you feel sad , you feel pissed off , but in the end , you feel alive - which is what they did . 
-1 dong never pushes for insights beyond the superficial tensions of the dynamic he's dissecting , and the film settles too easily along the contours of expectation . 
-1 'lovely and amazing , ' unhappily , is neither . . . excessively strained and contrived . 
-1 a trite psychological thriller designed to keep the audience guessing and guessing -- which is not to be confused with suspecting -- until it comes time to wrap things up and send the viewers home . 
-1 [u]nrelentingly stupid . 
-1 i would have preferred a transfer down the hall to mr . holland's class for the music , or to robin williams's lecture so i could listen to a teacher with humor , passion , and verve . 
-1 gussied up with so many distracting special effects and visual party tricks that it's not clear whether we're supposed to shriek or laugh . 
+1 at its best , this is grand-scale moviemaking for a larger-than-life figure , an artist who has been awarded mythic status in contemporary culture . 
+1 here's a british flick gleefully unconcerned with plausibility , yet just as determined to entertain you . 
+1 the pianist is polanski's best film . 
+1 a dazzling dream of a documentary . 
+1 the engagingly primitive animated special effects contribute to a mood that's sustained through the surprisingly somber conclusion . 
-1 draggin' about dragons
+1 by applying definition to both sides of the man , the picture realizes a fullness that does not negate the subject . 
+1 a film with contemporary political resonance illustrated by a winning family story . 
+1 the 3d images only enhance the film's otherworldly quality , giving it a strange combo of you-are-there closeness with the disorienting unreality of the seemingly broken-down fourth wall of the movie screen . 
+1 the warnings to resist temptation in this film . . . are blunt and challenging and offer no easy rewards for staying clean . 
+1 as the story moves inexorably through its seven day timeframe , the picture becomes increasingly mesmerizing . 
-1 a relentless , bombastic and ultimately empty world war ii action flick . 
+1 'if you are in the mood for an intelligent weepy , it can easily worm its way into your heart . '
-1 it makes me feel weird / thinking about all the bad things in the world / like puppies with broken legs / and butterflies that die / and movies starring pop queens
+1 for the most part , it's a work of incendiary genius , steering clear of knee-jerk reactions and quick solutions . 
+1 none of his actors stand out , but that's less of a problem here than it would be in another film : characterization matters less than atmosphere . 
+1 if it's not entirely memorable , the movie is certainly easy to watch . 
+1 you don't know whether to admire the film's stately nature and call it classicism or be exasperated by a noticeable lack of pace . or both . 
-1 sweet home alabama certainly won't be remembered as one of [witherspoon's] better films . 
+1 melds derivative elements into something that is often quite rich and exciting , and always a beauty to behold . 
-1 if shayamalan wanted to tell a story about a man who loses his faith , why didn't he just do it , instead of using bad sci-fi as window dressing ? 
+1 this is mostly well-constructed fluff , which is all it seems intended to be . 
+1 many insightful moments . 
-1  . . . little more than a well-acted television melodrama shot for the big screen . 
+1 grant gets to display his cadness to perfection , but also to show acting range that may surprise some who thought light-hearted comedy was his forte . 
-1 an allegory concerning the chronically mixed signals african american professionals get about overachieving could be intriguing , but the supernatural trappings only obscure the message . 
-1 if jews were catholics , this would be catechism
+1 nolan bravely treads where few american films dare to delve -- into the world of ambivalence and ambiguity . . . 
-1 an eccentric little comic/thriller deeply in love with its own quirky personality . 
-1 britney spears' phoniness is nothing compared to the movie's contrived , lame screenplay and listless direction . 
+1 a heartbreakingly thoughtful minor classic , the work of a genuine and singular artist . 
-1 most fish stories are a little peculiar , but this is one that should be thrown back in the river . 
+1 touché ! 
-1 the issue of faith is not explored very deeply
-1 sometimes smart but more often sophomoric . 
+1 an enjoyable comedy of lingual and cultural differences the château is a film -- full of life and small delights -- that has all the wiggling energy of young kitten . 
-1 one thing's for sureif george romero had directed this movie , it wouldn't have taken the protagonists a full hour to determine that in order to kill a zombie you must shoot it in the head . 
-1 undone by its overly complicated and derivative screenplay , the glacier-paced direction and the stereotypical characters . 
+1 the dragons are the real stars of reign of fire and you won't be disappointed . 
+1 leguizamo and jones are both excellent and the rest of the cast is uniformly superb . 
-1 as 'chick flicks' go , this one is pretty miserable , resorting to string-pulling rather than legitimate character development and intelligent plotting . 
+1  " the turntable is now outselling the electric guitar . . . " 
+1 a movie that will touch the hearts of both children and adults , as well as bring audiences to the edge of their seats . 
+1 a twisty , moody slice of southern gothic . . . 
-1 with jump cuts , fast editing and lots of pyrotechnics , yu clearly hopes to camouflage how bad his movie is . he fails . 
+1 more of the same from taiwanese auteur tsai ming-liang , which is good news to anyone who's fallen under the sweet , melancholy spell of this unique director's previous films . 
+1 dark and disturbing , yet compelling to watch . 
-1 'this movie sucks . '
+1 visits spy-movie territory like a novel you can't put down , examines a footnote to history seldom brought to light on the screen , and keeps you guessing from first frame to last . 
+1 matches neorealism's impact by showing the humanity of a war-torn land filled with people who just want to live their lives . 
-1 feels like the work of an artist who is simply tired -- of fighting the same fights , of putting the weight of the world on his shoulders , of playing with narrative form . 
-1 an inept , tedious spoof of '70s kung fu pictures , it contains almost enough chuckles for a three-minute sketch , and no more . 
+1 it's the chemistry between the women and the droll scene-stealing wit and wolfish pessimism of anna chancellor that makes this " two weddings and a funeral " fun . 
+1 the woodman seems to have directly influenced this girl-meets-girl love story , but even more reassuring is how its makers actually seem to understand what made allen's romantic comedies so pertinent and enduring . 
+1 taken outside the context of the current political climate ( see : terrorists are more evil than ever ! ) , the sum of all fears is simply a well-made and satisfying thriller . 
+1 the am-radio soundtrack and game cast -- tierney and the inimitable walken especially -- keep this unusual comedy from choking on its own conceit . 
-1 will give many ministers and bible-study groups hours of material to discuss . but mainstream audiences will find little of interest in this film , which is often preachy and poorly acted . 
-1 she's not yet an actress , not quite a singer . . . 
-1 the element of surprise might be the only thing femme fatale has going for it . 
+1 passions , obsessions , and loneliest dark spots are pushed to their most virtuous limits , lending the narrative an unusually surreal tone . 
-1 showtime's starry cast could be both an asset and a detriment . those who trek to the 'plex predisposed to like it probably will enjoy themselves . but ticket-buyers with great expectations will wind up as glum as mr . de niro . 
-1 with tiny little jokes and nary an original idea , this sappy ethnic sleeper proves that not only blockbusters pollute the summer movie pool . 
+1 borrows a bit from the classics " wait until dark " and " extremities " . . . but in terms of its style , the movie is in a class by itself . 
-1 the fetid underbelly of fame has never looked uglier . 
+1 a fast paced and suspenseful argentinian thriller about the shadow side of play . 
+1 spend your benjamins on a matinee . 
-1 after a while , hoffman's quirks and mannerisms , particularly his penchant for tearing up on cue -- things that seem so real in small doses -- become annoying and artificial . 
+1 ms . hutchins is talented enough and charismatic enough to make us care about zelda's ultimate fate . 
-1 by the time you reach the finale , you're likely wondering why you've been watching all this strutting and posturing . 
-1 it's mildly sentimental , unabashedly consumerist . . . studiously inoffensive and completely disposable . 
+1 the disarming cornball atmosphere has a way of infecting the entire crowd as the film rolls on . 
+1 nair doesn't treat the issues lightly . she allows each character to confront their problems openly and honestly . 
-1 your stomach for heaven depends largely on your appetite for canned corn . 
-1 the things this movie tries to get the audience to buy just won't fly with most intelligent viewers . 
+1 delirious fun . 
-1 very well made , but doesn't generate a lot of tension . 
+1 a high-spirited buddy movie about the reunion of berlin anarchists who face arrest 15 years after their crime . 
-1 i'm just too bored to care . 
-1 the documentary is much too conventional -- lots of boring talking heads , etc . -- to do the subject matter justice . 
+1 the pleasures of super troopers may be fleeting , but they'll register strongly with anybody who still retains a soft spot for precollegiate humor . 
+1 entertaining despite its one-joke premise with the thesis that women from venus and men from mars can indeed get together . 
+1 though the aboriginal aspect lends the ending an extraordinary poignancy , and the story itself could be played out in any working class community in the nation . 
-1 howard conjures the past via surrealist flourishes so overwrought you'd swear he just stepped out of a buñuel retrospective . 
+1 it understands , in a way that speaks forcefully enough about the mechanisms of poverty to transcend the rather simplistic filmmaking . 
-1 in spite of featuring a script credited to no fewer than five writers , apparently nobody here bothered to check it twice . 
-1 harvard man is a semi-throwback , a reminiscence without nostalgia or sentimentality . 
-1 bond-inspired ? certainly . likely to have decades of life as a classic movie franchise ? let's hope not . 
-1 resident evil isn't a product of its cinematic predecessors so much as an mtv , sugar hysteria , and playstation cocktail . 
+1 a crisp psychological drama [and] a fascinating little thriller that would have been perfect for an old " twilight zone " episode . 
+1 while guzmán frustratingly refuses to give pinochet's crimes a political context , his distance from the material is mostly admirable . 
+1 affable if not timeless , like mike raises some worthwhile themes while delivering a wholesome fantasy for kids . 
+1 another one of those estrogen overdose movies like " divine secrets of the ya ya sisterhood , " except that the writing , acting and character development are a lot better . 
-1 the movie gets muted and routine . 
+1 'possession , ' based on the book by a . s . byatt , demands that labute deal with the subject of love head-on ; trading in his cynicism for reverence and a little wit
+1 psychologically savvy . 
-1 too intensely focused on the travails of being hal hartley to function as pastiche , no such thing is hartley's least accessible screed yet . 
-1 routine and rather silly . 
+1 the passions aroused by the discord between old and new cultures are set against the strange , stark beauty of the mideast desert , so lovingly and perceptively filmed that you can almost taste the desiccated air . 
+1 likeable thanks to its cast , its cuisine and its quirky tunes . 
-1 sometimes it feels as if it might have been made in the '70s or '80s , and starred chevy chase and goldie hawn . 
+1 an unabashedly schmaltzy and thoroughly enjoyable true story . 
+1 carrying off a spot-on scottish burr , duvall ( also a producer ) peels layers from this character that may well not have existed on paper . 
-1 the film contains no good jokes , no good scenes , barely a moment when carvey's saturday night live-honed mimicry rises above the level of embarrassment . 
+1 still pretentious and filled with subtext , but entertaining enough at 'face value' to recommend to anyone looking for something different . 
-1 it's a film with an idea buried somewhere inside its fabric , but never clearly seen or felt . 
-1 almost gags on its own gore . 
-1 brainless , but enjoyably over-the-top , the retro gang melodrama , deuces wild represents fifties teen-gang machismo in a way that borders on rough-trade homo-eroticism . 
-1 an appalling 'ace ventura' rip-off that somehow manages to bring together kevin pollak , former wrestler chyna and dolly parton . if any of them list this 'credit' on their resumes in the future , that'll be much funnier than anything in the film . . . 
-1 all analyze that proves is that there is really only one movie's worth of decent gags to be gleaned from the premise . 
-1  . . . generically , forgettably pleasant from start to finish . 
-1 entertains not so much because of its music or comic antics , but through the perverse pleasure of watching disney scrape the bottom of its own cracker barrel . 
-1 the film affords us intriguing glimpses of the insights gleaned from a lifetime of spiritual inquiry , but ram dass : fierce grace doesn't organize it with any particular insight . 
+1 a psychological thriller with a smart script and an obsessive-compulsive's attention to detail . 
+1 the charm of the first movie is still there , and the story feels like the logical , unforced continuation of the careers of a pair of spy kids . 
-1 terrible . 
+1 even though the film doesn't manage to hit all of its marks , it's still entertaining to watch the target practice . 
+1 garcía bernal and talancón are an immensely appealing couple , and even though their story is predictable , you'll want things to work out . 
+1 maguire is a surprisingly effective peter/spider-man . 
-1 creepy but ultimately unsatisfying thriller . 
-1 a 'girls gone wild' video for the boho art-house crowd , the burning sensation isn't a definitive counter-cultural document -- its makers aren't removed and inquisitive enough for that . 
-1 i can't begin to tell you how tedious , how resolutely unamusing , how thoroughly unrewarding all of this is , and what a reckless squandering of four fine acting talents . . . 
+1 the best revenge may just be living well because this film , unlike other dumas adaptations , is far more likened to a treasure than a lengthy jail sentence . 
+1 believes so fervently in humanity that it feels almost anachronistic , and it is too cute by half . but arriving at a particularly dark moment in history , it offers flickering reminders of the ties that bind us . 
-1 the thriller side of this movie is falling flat , as the stalker doesn't do much stalking , and no cop or lawyer grasps the concept of actually investigating the case . 
+1 a venturesome , beautifully realized psychological mood piece that reveals its first-time feature director's understanding of the expressive power of the camera . 
-1 at its best , queen is campy fun like the vincent price horror classics of the '60s . at its worst , it implodes in a series of very bad special effects . 
+1 the all-french cast is marveilleux . 
+1 an entertaining , if ultimately minor , thriller . 
-1 despite a blue-chip cast and a provocative title , writer-director peter mattei's first feature microwaves dull leftover romantic motifs basted in faux-contemporary gravy . 
+1 oddly compelling . 
-1 a preposterous , prurient whodunit . 
+1 the film is a blunt indictment , part of a perhaps surreal campaign to bring kissinger to trial for crimes against humanity . 
+1 jolie gives it that extra little something that makes it worth checking out at theaters , especially if you're in the mood for something more comfortable than challenging . 
-1 another boorish movie from the i-heard-a-joke- at-a-frat-party school of screenwriting . 
-1 it's a sometimes interesting remake that doesn't compare to the brilliant original . 
-1 there's nothing remotely topical or sexy here . 
+1 the son of the bride's humour is born out of an engaging storyline , which also isn't embarrassed to make you reach for the tissues . this movie is to be cherished . 
-1 i'm sure the filmmaker would disagree , but , honestly , i don't see the point . it's a visual rorschach test and i must have failed . 
+1 though of particular interest to students and enthusiast of international dance and world music , the film is designed to make viewers of all ages , cultural backgrounds and rhythmic ability want to get up and dance . 
+1 neither the funniest film that eddie murphy nor robert de niro has ever made , showtime is nevertheless efficiently amusing for a good while . before it collapses into exactly the kind of buddy cop comedy it set out to lampoon , anyway . 
-1 k-19 may not hold a lot of water as a submarine epic , but it holds even less when it turns into an elegiacally soggy saving private ryanovich . 
+1 a sports movie with action that's exciting on the field and a story you care about off it . 
+1 a touching , small-scale story of family responsibility and care in the community . 
-1 no movement , no yuks , not much of anything . 
+1 if you like an extreme action-packed film with a hint of humor , then triple x marks the spot . 
+1 for all its visual panache and compelling supporting characters , the heart of the film rests in the relationship between sullivan and his son . 
-1 a few zingers aside , the writing is indifferent , and jordan brady's direction is prosaic . 
+1 elegantly produced and expressively performed , the six musical numbers crystallize key plot moments into minutely detailed wonders of dreamlike ecstasy . 
+1 hollywood ending is not show-stoppingly hilarious , but scathingly witty nonetheless . 
+1 poignant and moving , a walk to remember is an inspirational love story , capturing the innocence and idealism of that first encounter . 
+1 even when foreign directors . . . borrow stuff from hollywood , they invariably shake up the formula and make it more interesting . 
+1 though everything might be literate and smart , it never took off and always seemed static . 
-1 whereas the extremely competent hitman films such as pulp fiction and get shorty resonate a sardonic verve to their caustic purpose for existing , who is cletis tout ? is an inexpressible and drab wannabe looking for that exact niche . 
-1 in the wake of saving private ryan , black hawk down and we were soldiers , you are likely to be as heartily sick of mayhem as cage's war-weary marine . 
-1 just because a walk to remember is shrewd enough to activate girlish tear ducts doesn't mean it's good enough for our girls . 
-1 but the power of these [subjects] is obscured by the majority of the film that shows a stationary camera on a subject that could be mistaken for giving a public oration , rather than contributing to a film's narrative . 
+1 once the downward spiral comes to pass , auto focus bears out as your typical junkie opera . . . 
-1 predictably melodramatic . 
+1 while it would be easy to give crush the new title of two weddings and a funeral , it's a far more thoughtful film than any slice of hugh grant whimsy . 
+1 the inherent strength of the material as well as the integrity of the filmmakers gives this coming-of-age story restraint as well as warmth . 
-1 if there's one thing this world needs less of , it's movies about college that are written and directed by people who couldn't pass an entrance exam . 
+1 highly engaging . 
+1 if you liked such movies as notting hill , four weddings and a funeral , bridget jones' diary or high fidelity , then you won't want to miss about a boy . 
+1 a rare and lightly entertaining look behind the curtain that separates comics from the people laughing in the crowd . 
-1 this film looks like it was produced in 1954 , shelved for 48 years , and repackaged for a 2002 audience . 
+1 the messy emotions raging throughout this three-hour effort are instantly recognizable , allowing the film to paradoxically feel familiar and foreign at the same time . 
+1 'moore is like a progressive bull in a china shop , a provocateur crashing into ideas and special-interest groups as he slaps together his own brand of liberalism . '
-1 there is so much plodding sensitivity . 
+1 the directive to protect the code at all costs also begins to blur as the importance of the man and the code merge
-1 a big fat pain . 
+1 it is an indelible epic american story about two families , one black and one white , facing change in both their inner and outer lives . 
+1 the screenplay never lets us forget that bourne was once an amoral assassin just like the ones who are pursuing him . . . there is never really a true " us " versus " them " . 
+1 enticing and often funny documentary . 
+1 i've yet to find an actual vietnam war combat movie actually produced by either the north or south vietnamese , but at least now we've got something pretty damn close . 
-1 this one is definitely one to skip , even for horror movie fanatics . 
-1 cold , sterile and lacking any color or warmth . 
-1 unfortunately , carvey's rubber-face routine is no match for the insipid script he has crafted with harris goldberg . 
-1 director dirk shafer and co-writer greg hinton ride the dubious divide where gay porn reaches for serious drama . 
-1 the notion of deleting emotion from people , even in an advanced prozac nation , is so insanely dysfunctional that the rampantly designed equilibrium becomes a concept doofus . 
-1 how much you are moved by the emotional tumult of [françois and michèle's] relationship depends a lot on how interesting and likable you find them . 
+1 a mesmerizing cinematic poem from the first frame to the last . 
+1 the format gets used best . . . to capture the dizzying heights achieved by motocross and bmx riders , whose balletic hotdogging occasionally ends in bone-crushing screwups . 
-1 the only thing worse than your substandard , run-of-the-mill hollywood picture is an angst-ridden attempt to be profound . 
+1 a taut psychological thriller that doesn't waste a moment of its two-hour running time . 
+1 a deftly entertaining film , smartly played and smartly directed . 
+1 may seriously impair your ability to ever again maintain a straight face while speaking to a highway patrolman . 
-1 the jokes are sophomoric , stereotypes are sprinkled everywhere and the acting ranges from bad to bodacious . 
+1 it's definitely a step in the right direction . 
+1 [drumline] is entertaining for what it does , and admirable for what it doesn't do . 
+1 an uplifting , near-masterpiece . 
+1 a first-class , thoroughly involving b movie that effectively combines two surefire , beloved genres -- the prison flick and the fight film . 
-1 the most ill-conceived animated comedy since the 1991 dog rover dangerfield . 
-1 i can't remember the last time i saw worse stunt editing or cheaper action movie production values than in extreme ops . 
-1 this story of unrequited love doesn't sustain interest beyond the first half-hour . 
-1 the characters are so generic and the plot so bland that even as rogue cia assassins working for chris cooper's agency boss close in on the resourceful amnesiac , we don't feel much for damon/bourne or his predicament . 
+1 it's like an old warner bros . costumer jived with sex -- this could be the movie errol flynn always wanted to make , though bette davis , cast as joan , would have killed him . 
-1 large budget notwithstanding , the movie is such a blip on the year's radar screen that it's tempting just to go with it for the ride . but this time , the old mib label stands for milder isn't better . 
-1 viewing this underdramatized but overstated film is like watching a transcript of a therapy session brought to humdrum life by some freudian puppet . 
-1 de niro cries . you'll cry for your money back . 
+1 this is carion's debut feature but his script and direction hums with a confidence that many spend entire careers trying to reach . 
+1 [hayek] throws herself into this dream hispanic role with a teeth-clenching gusto , she strikes a potent chemistry with molina and she gradually makes us believe she is kahlo . 
-1 bearable . barely . 
+1 the sentimental script has problems , but the actors pick up the slack . 
+1 as it turns out , you can go home again . 
-1 the new faces are interesting , but the old story isn't , especially when it starts to seem more improvised than scripted . 
+1 a penetrating glimpse into the tissue-thin ego of the stand-up comic . 
+1 the first half bursts with a goofy energy previous disney films only used for a few minutes here and there . 
+1 the movie is full of fine performances , led by josef bierbichler as brecht and monica bleibtreu as helene weigel , his wife . 
-1 christina ricci comedy about sympathy , hypocrisy and love is a misfire . 
+1 elling , portrayed with quiet fastidiousness by per christian ellefsen , is a truly singular character , one whose frailties are only slightly magnified versions of the ones that vex nearly everyone . 
+1 a fascinating case study of flower-power liberation -- and the price that was paid for it . 
+1 ferrara directs the entire film with the kind of detachment that makes any given frame look like a family's custom-made christmas card . 
-1 as violent , profane and exploitative as the most offensive action flick you've ever seen . 
-1 much like robin williams , death to smoochy has already reached its expiration date . 
+1 a captivatingly quirky hybrid of character portrait , romantic comedy and beat-the-clock thriller . 
-1 in its chicken heart , crush goes to absurd lengths to duck the very issues it raises . 
-1 just like hearst's enormous yacht , it's slow and unwieldy and takes a long time to reach its destination . 
-1 a well-intentioned effort that's still too burdened by the actor's offbeat sensibilities for the earnest emotional core to emerge with any degree of accessibility . 
+1 a distinguished and thoughtful film , marked by acute writing and a host of splendid performances . 
-1 its inescapable absurdities are tantamount to insulting the intelligence of anyone who hasn't been living under a rock ( since sept . 11 ) . 
-1 a mawkish self-parody that plays like some weird masterpiece theater sketch with neither a point of view nor a compelling reason for being . 
+1 the story loses its bite in a last-minute happy ending that's even less plausible than the rest of the picture . much of the way , though , this is a refreshingly novel ride . 
+1 sweetly sexy , funny and touching . 
+1 the perfect film for those who like sick comedies that can be snide . 
+1 there's plenty to enjoy -- in no small part thanks to lau . 
+1 ' . . . mafia , rap stars and hood rats butt their ugly heads in a regurgitation of cinematic violence that gives brutal birth to an unlikely , but likable , hero . '
-1 plays like some corny television production from a bygone era
+1 a deviant topical comedy which is funny from start to finish . 
+1 flavorful and romantic , you could call this how martha got her groove back -- assuming , that is , she ever had one to begin with . 
+1 the plot twists give i am trying to break your heart an attraction it desperately needed . 
+1 like other great documentaries . . . this goes after one truth ( the ford administration's complicity in tearing 'orphans' from their mothers ) and stumbles upon others even more compelling . 
+1  . . . a true delight . 
+1 an impressive debut for first-time writer-director mark romanek , especially considering his background is in music video . 
-1 possession is in the end an honorable , interesting failure . it falls far short of poetry , but it's not bad prose . 
+1 sade is an engaging look at the controversial eponymous and fiercely atheistic hero . 
-1 some actors steal scenes . tom green just gives them a bad odor . this self-infatuated goofball is far from the only thing wrong with the clumsy comedy stealing harvard , but he's the most obvious one . 
-1 reign of fire never comes close to recovering from its demented premise , but it does sustain an enjoyable level of ridiculousness . 
-1 wes craven's presence is felt ; not the craven of 'a nightmare on elm street' or 'the hills have eyes , ' but the sad schlock merchant of 'deadly friend . '
-1 as dumb and cheesy as they may be , the cartoons look almost shakespearean -- both in depth and breadth -- after watching this digital-effects-heavy , supposed family-friendly comedy . 
+1 this flick is about as cool and crowd-pleasing as a documentary can get . 
-1 [lin chung's] voice is rather unexceptional , even irritating ( at least to this western ear ) , making it awfully hard to buy the impetus for the complicated love triangle that develops between the three central characters .

+1 greengrass ( working from don mullan's script ) forgoes the larger socio-political picture of the situation in northern ireland in favour of an approach that throws one in the pulsating thick of a truly frightening situation . 
-1 a few hours after you've seen it , you forget you've been to the movies . 
-1 while it's genuinely cool to hear characters talk about early rap records ( sugar hill gang , etc . ) , the constant referencing of hip-hop arcana can alienate even the savviest audiences . 
+1 promises is one film that's truly deserving of its oscar nomination . 
+1 it's the sweet cinderella story that " pretty woman " wanted to be . 
+1 the fun of the movie is the chance it affords to watch jackson , who also served as executive producer , take his smooth , shrewd , powerful act abroad . 
-1 bisset delivers a game performance , but she is unable to save the movie . 
-1 totally overwrought , deeply biased , and wholly designed to make you feel guilty about ignoring what the filmmakers clearly believe are the greatest musicians of all time . 
-1 pleasant but not more than recycled jock piffle . 
-1 a mild , reluctant , thumbs down . 
+1 in questioning the election process , payami graphically illustrates the problems of fledgling democracies , but also the strength and sense of freedom the iranian people already possess , with or without access to the ballot box . 
+1 parker cannot sustain the buoyant energy level of the film's city beginnings into its country conclusion
-1 although disney follows its standard formula in this animated adventure , it feels more forced than usual . 
-1 there are few things more frustrating to a film buff than seeing an otherwise good movie marred beyond redemption by a disastrous ending . 
+1 a penetrating , potent exploration of sanctimony , self-awareness , self-hatred and self-determination . 
-1 the overall vibe is druggy and self-indulgent , like a spring-break orgy for pretentious arts majors . 
-1 more maudlin than sharp . 
-1 the filmmakers keep pushing the jokes at the expense of character until things fall apart . 
+1 worth seeing just for weaver and lapaglia . 
-1 slap me , i saw this movie . 
+1 an intelligent fiction about learning through cultural clash . 
+1 a sensitive , moving , brilliantly constructed work . 
+1 broomfield reveals an ironic manifestation of institutionalized slavery that ties a black-owned record label with a white-empowered police force . 
-1 john mctiernan's botched remake may be subtler than norman jewison's 1975 ultraviolent futuristic corporate-sports saga . it's also stupider . 
-1 like showgirls and glitter , the most entertaining moments here are unintentional . 
+1 brings an irresistible blend of warmth and humor and a consistent embracing humanity in the face of life's harshness . 
-1 looks like a high school film project completed the day before it was due . 
+1 maybe it's just because this past year has seen the release of some of the worst film comedies in decades . . . but honestly , analyze that really isn't all that bad . 
-1 lawrence preaches strictly to the converted . 
-1 you have once again entered the bizarre realm where director adrian lyne holds sway , where all relationships are simultaneously broadly metaphorical , oddly abstract , and excruciatingly literal . 
+1 notorious c . h . o . has oodles of vulgar highlights . 
+1 as surreal as a dream and as detailed as a photograph , as visually dexterous as it is at times imaginatively overwhelming . 
-1 miller is playing so free with emotions , and the fact that children are hostages to fortune , that he makes the audience hostage to his swaggering affectation of seriousness . 
-1 does not go far enough in its humor or stock ideas to stand out as particularly memorable or even all that funny . 
+1 koury frighteningly and honestly exposes one teenager's uncomfortable class resentment and , in turn , his self-inflicted retaliation . 
+1 [reaches] wholly believable and heart-wrenching depths of despair . 
+1 it works well enough , since the thrills pop up frequently , and the dispatching of the cast is as often imaginative as it is gory . 
+1 a picture that extols the virtues of comradeship and community in a spunky , spirited fashion . 
-1 this rough trade punch-and-judy act didn't play well then and it plays worse now . 
+1 it's surprisingly decent , particularly for a tenth installment in a series . 
+1 rich in detail , gorgeously shot and beautifully acted , les destinees is , in its quiet , epic way , daring , inventive and refreshingly unusual . 
-1 the movie would seem less of a trifle if ms . sugarman followed through on her defiance of the saccharine . 
+1 i won't argue with anyone who calls 'slackers' dumb , insulting , or childish . . . but i laughed so much that i didn't mind . 
-1 the next big thing's not-so-big ( and not-so-hot ) directorial debut . 
-1 its premise is smart , but the execution is pretty weary . 
-1 a half-assed film . 
-1 death might be a release . 
-1 i believe silberling had the best intentions here , but he just doesn't have the restraint to fully realize them . 
+1 how i killed my father would be a rarity in hollywood . it's an actor's showcase that accomplishes its primary goal without the use of special effects , but rather by emphasizing the characters -- including the supporting ones . 
-1 for all its shoot-outs , fistfights , and car chases , this movie is a phlegmatic bore , so tedious it makes the silly spy vs . spy film the sum of all fears , starring ben affleck , seem downright hitchcockian . 
-1 supposedly authentic account of a historical event that's far too tragic to merit such superficial treatment . 
-1 seagal , who looks more like danny aiello these days , mumbles his way through the movie . 
-1 it is messy , uncouth , incomprehensible , vicious and absurd . 
+1 each of these stories has the potential for touched by an angel simplicity and sappiness , but thirteen conversations about one thing , for all its generosity and optimism , never resorts to easy feel-good sentiments . 
-1 a movie so bad that it quickly enters the pantheon of wreckage that includes battlefield earth and showgirls . 
+1  . . . the kind of entertainment that parents love to have their kids see . 
-1 the film's most improbable feat ? it didn't go straight to video . 
-1 if it's seldom boring , well , it's also rarely coherent . 
-1 mostly the film is just hectic and homiletic : two parts exhausting men in black mayhem to one part family values . 
+1 while cherish doesn't completely survive its tonal transformation from dark comedy to suspense thriller , it's got just enough charm and appealing character quirks to forgive that still serious problem . 
+1 renner's performance as dahmer is unforgettable , deeply absorbing . 
-1 meanders between its powerful moments . 
+1 isn't quite the equal of woo's best earlier work , but it's easily his finest american film . . . comes close to recapturing the brilliance of his hong kong films . 
-1 basically a static series of semi-improvised ( and semi-coherent ) raps between the stars . 
+1 time is a beautiful film to watch , an interesting and at times captivating take on loss and loneliness . 
+1 a witty , low-key romantic comedy . 
+1 canada's arctic light shines bright on this frozen tundra soap opera that breathes extraordinary life into the private existence of the inuit people . 
+1 a chance to see three splendid actors turn a larky chase movie into an emotionally satisfying exploration of the very human need to be somebody , and to belong to somebody . 
+1 it is amusing , and that's all it needs to be . 
+1 an original gem about an obsession with time . 
-1 this may be the dumbest , sketchiest movie on record about an aspiring writer's coming-of-age . 
-1 charly comes off as emotionally manipulative and sadly imitative of innumerable past love story derisions . 
+1 enjoyably dumb , sweet , and intermittently hilarious -- if you've a taste for the quirky , steal a glimpse . 
-1 the problem with the mayhem in formula 51 is not that it's offensive , but that it's boring . 
+1 you really have to salute writer-director haneke ( he adapted elfriede jelinek's novel ) for making a film that isn't nearly as graphic but much more powerful , brutally shocking and difficult to watch . 
+1 audiences conditioned to getting weepy over saucer-eyed , downy-cheeked moppets and their empathetic caretakers will probably feel emotionally cheated by the film's tart , sugar-free wit . 
-1 the movie , like bartleby , is something of a stiff -- an extra-dry office comedy that seems twice as long as its 83 minutes . 
-1 formula 51 has dulled your senses faster and deeper than any recreational drug on the market . 
+1 would you laugh if a tuba-playing dwarf rolled down a hill in a trash can ? do you chuckle at the thought of an ancient librarian whacking a certain part of a man's body ? if you answered yes , by all means enjoy the new guy . 
-1 dull and mechanical , kinda like a very goofy museum exhibit
-1 manipulative claptrap , a period-piece movie-of-the-week , plain old blarney . . . take your pick . all three descriptions suit evelyn , a besotted and obvious drama that tells us nothing new . 
+1 the movie addresses a hungry need for pg-rated , nonthreatening family movies , but it doesn't go too much further . 
+1 australian filmmaker david flatman uses the huge-screen format to make an old-fashioned nature film that educates viewers with words and pictures while entertaining them . 
-1 has all the depth of a wading pool . 
+1 with an admirably dark first script by brent hanley , paxton , making his directorial feature debut , does strong , measured work . 
-1 a film that clearly means to preach exclusively to the converted . 
-1 demme finally succeeds in diminishing his stature from oscar-winning master to lowly studio hack . 
-1 kenneth branagh's energetic sweet-and-sour performance as a curmudgeonly british playwright grounds this overstuffed , erratic dramedy in which he and his improbably forbearing wife contend with craziness and child-rearing in los angeles . 
-1 the movie has generic virtues , and despite a lot of involved talent , seems done by the numbers . 
-1 sheridan's take on the author's schoolboy memoir . . . is a rather toothless take on a hard young life . 
+1 morvern rocks . 
+1 the seaside splendor and shallow , beautiful people are nice to look at while you wait for the story to get going . 
-1 as much as i laughed throughout the movie , i cannot mount a cogent defense of the film as entertainment , or even performance art , although the movie does leave you marveling at these guys' superhuman capacity to withstand pain . 
-1 expect the same-old , lame-old slasher nonsense , just with different scenery . 
+1 it's a fun adventure movie for kids ( of all ages ) that like adventure . 
+1 sandra nettelbeck beautifully orchestrates the transformation of the chilly , neurotic , and self-absorbed martha as her heart begins to open . 
-1 becomes the last thing you would expect from a film with this title or indeed from any plympton film : boring . 
+1 it may not be particularly innovative , but the film's crisp , unaffected style and air of gentle longing make it unexpectedly rewarding . 
+1 it is not a mass-market entertainment but an uncompromising attempt by one artist to think about another . 
-1 after collateral damage , you might imagine that most every aggrieved father cliché has been unturned . but no . 
-1 a sentimental hybrid that could benefit from the spice of specificity . 
-1 done in mostly by a weak script that can't support the epic treatment . 
+1 the film does give a pretty good overall picture of the situation in laramie following the murder of matthew shepard . 
+1 [a] thoughtful , visually graceful work . 
-1 the story alone could force you to scratch a hole in your head . 
+1 this is an elegantly balanced movie -- every member of the ensemble has something fascinating to do -- that doesn't reveal even a hint of artifice . 
-1 just a bloody mess . 
+1 a film of quiet power . 
-1 becomes a bit of a mishmash : a tearjerker that doesn't and a thriller that won't . 
+1  . . . a light , yet engrossing piece . lux , now in her eighties , does a great combination act as narrator , jewish grandmother and subject  taking us through a film that is part biography , part entertainment and part history . 
-1 no new plot conceptions or environmental changes , just different bodies for sharp objects to rip through . 
-1 eventually , they will have a showdown , but , by then , your senses are as mushy as peas and you don't care who fires the winning shot . 
-1 what madonna does here can't properly be called acting -- more accurately , it's moving and it's talking and it's occasionally gesturing , sometimes all at once . 
-1 in a strange way , egoyan has done too much . he's worked too hard on this movie . 
+1 what's most memorable about circuit is that it's shot on digital video , whose tiny camera enables shafer to navigate spaces both large . . . and small . . . with considerable aplomb . 
+1 martyr gets royally screwed and comes back for more . 
-1 a blair witch- style adventure that plays like a bad soap opera , with passable performances from everyone in the cast . 
-1 circuit queens won't learn a thing , they'll be too busy cursing the film's strategically placed white sheets . 
+1 feeling like a dope has rarely been more fun than it is in nine queens . 
-1 an ugly-duckling tale so hideously and clumsily told it feels accidental . 
-1  . . . the same tired old gags , modernized for the extreme sports generation . there's already been too many of these films . . . 
+1 mr . tsai is a very original artist in his medium , and what time is it there ? should be seen at the very least for its spasms of absurdist humor . 
+1 an intelligent , multi-layered and profoundly humanist ( not to mention gently political ) meditation on the values of knowledge , education , and the affects of cultural and geographical displacement . 
+1 macdowell . . . gives give a solid , anguished performance that eclipses nearly everything else she's ever done . 
-1 feels strangely hollow at its emotional core . 
-1 about the only thing to give the movie points for is bravado -- to take an entirely stale concept and push it through the audience's meat grinder one more time . 
-1 what you would end up with if you took orwell , bradbury , kafka , george lucas and the wachowski brothers and threw them into a blender . but that's just the problem with it - the director hasn't added enough of his own ingredients . 
+1 displaying about equal amounts of naiveté , passion and talent , beneath clouds establishes sen as a filmmaker of considerable potential . 
-1 all the more disquieting for its relatively gore-free allusions to the serial murders , but it falls down in its attempts to humanize its subject . 
-1 there are now two signs that m . night shyamalan's debut feature sucked up all he has to give to the mystic genres of cinema : unbreakable and signs . 
-1 a sequence of ridiculous shoot-'em-up scenes . 
+1 suspend your disbelief here and now , or you'll be shaking your head all the way to the credits . 
-1 the original wasn't a good movie but this remake makes it look like a masterpiece ! 
+1 jirí hubac's script is a gem . his characters are engaging , intimate and the dialogue is realistic and greatly moving . the scope of the silberstein family is large and we grow attached to their lives , full of strength , warmth and vitality . . 
+1 exquisitely acted and masterfully if preciously interwoven [the film] addresses in a fascinating , intelligent manner the intermingling of race , politics and local commerce . 
+1 the slam-bang superheroics are kinetic enough to engross even the most antsy youngsters . 
-1 it's a very sincere work , but it would be better as a diary or documentary . 
-1 the densest distillation of roberts' movies ever made . 
-1 director barry skolnick and his screenwriters glibly tick off every point of " the longest yard " playbook like a checklist . 
-1 content merely to lionize its title character and exploit his anger - all for easy sanctimony , formulaic thrills and a ham-fisted sermon on the need for national health insurance . 
-1 works better in the conception than it does in the execution . . . winds up seeming just a little too clever . 
+1 a delirious celebration of the female orgasm . 
-1 like its script , which nurses plot holes gaping enough to pilot an entire olympic swim team through , the characters in swimfan seem motivated by nothing short of dull , brain-deadening hangover . 
-1 the movie suffers from two fatal ailments -- a dearth of vitality and a story that's shapeless and uninflected . 
+1 it's an entertaining movie , and the effects , boosted to the size of a downtown hotel , will all but take you to outer space . 
+1 the wonderful combination of the sweetness and the extraordinary technical accomplishments of the first film are maintained , but its overall impact falls a little flat with a storyline that never quite delivers the original magic . 
-1 this insufferable movie is meant to make you think about existential suffering . instead , it'll only put you to sleep . 
+1 not only does spider-man deliver , but i suspect it might deliver again and again . 
-1 imagine a film that begins as a seven rip-off , only to switch to a mix of the shining , the thing , and any naked teenagers horror flick from the 1980s . 
+1 [d]espite its familiar subject matter , ice age is consistently amusing and engrossing . . . 
-1 the picture seems uncertain whether it wants to be an acidic all-male all about eve or a lush , swooning melodrama in the intermezzo strain . 
+1 no one goes unindicted here , which is probably for the best . and if you're not nearly moved to tears by a couple of scenes , you've got ice water in your veins . 
+1 steers has an unexpectedly adamant streak of warm-blooded empathy for all his disparate manhattan denizens--especially the a * * holes . 
+1 a film of delicate interpersonal dances . caine makes us watch as his character awakens to the notion that to be human is eventually to have to choose . it's a sight to behold . 
+1 it asks nothing of the audience other than to sit back and enjoy a couple of great actors hamming it up . 
-1 serviceable at best , slightly less than serviceable at worst . 
+1 the komediant is a tale worth catching . 
-1 before it takes a sudden turn and devolves into a bizarre sort of romantic comedy , steven shainberg's adaptation of mary gaitskill's harrowing short story . . . is a brilliantly played , deeply unsettling experience . 
+1 i don't know precisely what to make of steven soderbergh's full frontal , though that didn't stop me from enjoying much of it . 
+1 if [jaglom's] latest effort is not the director at his most sparkling , some of its repartee is still worth hearing . 
+1 fred schepisi's film is paced at a speed that is slow to those of us in middle age and deathly slow to any teen . with a cast of a-list brit actors , it is worth searching out . 
-1 the very definition of what critics have come to term an " ambitious failure . " 
-1 the pacing is deadly , the narration helps little and naipaul , a juicy writer , is negated . 
+1 vereté has a whip-smart sense of narrative bluffs . 
+1 never [sinks] into exploitation .
