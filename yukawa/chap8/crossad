-1 a mawkish , implausible platonic romance that makes chaplin's city lights seem dispassionate by comparison .

-1 matthew mcconaughey tries , and fails , to control the screen with swaggering machismo and over-the-top lunacy . 
-1 the pace of the film is very slow ( for obvious reasons ) and that too becomes off-putting . 
-1 the story drifts so inexorably into cliches about tortured ( and torturing ) artists and consuming but impossible love that you can't help but become more disappointed as each overwrought new sequence plods on .

+1 all in all , a great party . 
-1 the only thing i laughed at were the people who paid to see it .

+1 300 years of russian history and culture compressed into an evanescent , seamless and sumptuous stream of consciousness .

-1 statham employs an accent that i think is supposed to be an attempt at hardass american but sometimes just lapses into unhidden british . 
+1 as directed by dani kouyate of burkina faso , sia lacks visual flair . but kouyate elicits strong performances from his cast , and he delivers a powerful commentary on how governments lie , no matter who runs them . 
+1 very well written and directed with brutal honesty and respect for its audience . 
-1 admirably ambitious but self-indulgent .

-1 the truth about charlie is that it's a brazenly misguided project . 
-1 a real snooze .

+1 the characters are complex and quirky , but entirely believable as the remarkable ensemble cast brings them to life . 
+1 [there's] quite a bit of heart , as you would expect from the directors of the little mermaid and aladdin . 
+1 succeeds only because bullock and grant were made to share the silver screen . 
+1 a charming , banter-filled comedy . . . one of those airy cinematic bon bons whose aims -- and by extension , accomplishments -- seem deceptively slight on the surface .

+1 though only 60 minutes long , the film is packed with information and impressions . 
-1 there are weird resonances between actor and role here , and they're not exactly flattering . 
+1 apart from its own considerable achievement , metropolis confirms tezuka's status as both the primary visual influence on the animé tradition and its defining philosophical conscience . 
+1 remarkable for its excellent storytelling , its economical , compressed characterisations and for its profound humanity , it's an adventure story and history lesson all in one . 
-1 the plot convolutions ultimately add up to nothing more than jerking the audience's chain . 
-1 it's of the quality of a lesser harrison ford movie - six days , seven nights , maybe , or that dreadful sabrina remake . 
-1 lush and beautifully photographed ( somebody suggested the stills might make a nice coffee table book ) , but ultimately you'll leave the theater wondering why these people mattered . 
-1 the sort of picture in which , whenever one of the characters has some serious soul searching to do , they go to a picture-perfect beach during sunset . 
-1 call me a cold-hearted curmudgeon for not being able to enjoy a mindless action movie , but i believe a movie can be mindless without being the peak of all things insipid . 
-1 swinging , the film makes it seem , is not a hobby that attracts the young and fit . or intelligent . 
-1 it may be a prize winner , but teacher is a bomb . 
+1 birthday girl walks a tricky tightrope between being wickedly funny and just plain wicked . 
-1 focuses on joan's raging hormones and sledgehammers the audience with spanish inquisitions about her " madness " so much that i became mad that i wasted 123 minutes and $9 . 50 on this 21st century torture device . 
-1 so clichéd that , at one point , they literally upset an apple cart . 
-1 bullock's complete lack of focus and ability quickly derails the film
+1 it's all entertaining enough , but don't look for any hefty anti-establishment message in what is essentially a whip-crack of a buddy movie that ends with a whimper . 
+1 neither quite a comedy nor a romance , more of an impish divertissement of themes that interest attal and gainsbourg -- they live together -- the film has a lot of charm . 
-1 to say this was done better in wilder's some like it hot is like saying the sun rises in the east . 
-1 cho's fans are sure to be entertained ; it's only fair in the interest of full disclosure to say that -- on the basis of this film alone -- i'm not one of them . 
+1 bleakly funny , its characters all the more touching for refusing to pity or memorialize themselves . 
+1 not far beneath the surface , this reconfigured tale asks disturbing questions about those things we expect from military epics .

-1 those who are only mildly curious , i fear , will be put to sleep or bewildered by the artsy and often pointless visuals . 
+1 nair and writer laura cahill dare to build a movie around some flawed but rather unexceptional women , emerging with a fine character study that's short on plot but rich in the tiny revelations of real life .

+1 vibrantly colored and beautifully designed , metropolis is a feast for the eyes . 
-1 i can analyze this movie in three words : thumbs friggin' down .

+1 [shyamalan] continues to cut a swathe through mainstream hollywood , while retaining an integrity and refusing to compromise his vision . 
-1 the movie just has too much on its plate to really stay afloat for its just under ninety minute running time . 
+1 touches smartly and wistfully on a number of themes , not least the notion that the marginal members of society . . . might benefit from a helping hand and a friendly kick in the pants .

-1 being unique doesn't necessarily equate to being good , no matter how admirably the filmmakers have gone for broke . 
-1 disturbingly superficial in its approach to the material . 
+1 graham greene's novel of colonialism and empire is elevated by michael caine's performance as a weary journalist in a changing world . 
-1 a stupid , derivative horror film that substitutes extreme gore for suspense . 
-1 all the sensuality , all the eroticism of a good vampire tale has been , pardon the pun , sucked out and replaced by goth goofiness . 
-1 never does " lilo & stitch " reach the emotion or timelessness of disney's great past , or even that of more recent successes such as " mulan " or " tarzan . " 
+1 it's a fine , old-fashioned-movie movie , which is to say it's unburdened by pretensions to great artistic significance . 
+1 worth the effort to watch . 
-1 we hate [madonna] within the film's first five minutes , and she lacks the skill or presence to regain any ground . 
-1 before long , the film starts playing like general hospital crossed with a saturday night live spoof of dog day afternoon . 
-1 perhaps a better celebration of these unfairly dismissed heroes would be a film that isn't this painfully forced , false and fabricated . 
+1 it's excessively quirky and a little underconfident in its delivery , but otherwise this is the best 'old neighborhood' project since christopher walken kinda romanced cyndi lauper in the opportunists . 
+1 [haynes'] homage to such films as " all that heaven allows " and " imitation of life " transcends them . simply put , " far from heaven " is a masterpiece . 
+1 the 1960s rebellion was misdirected : you can't fight your culture . 
-1 depressingly thin and exhaustingly contrived . only masochistic moviegoers need apply . 
+1 nicks sustains the level of exaggerated , stylized humor throughout by taking your expectations and twisting them just a bit . 
+1 the footage of the rappers at play and the prison interview with suge knight are just two of the elements that will grab you . 
+1 a vibrant , colorful , semimusical rendition . 
+1 left me with the visceral sensation of longing , lasting traces of charlotte's web of desire and desperation . 
+1 münch's genuine insight makes the film's occasional overindulgence forgivable .

-1 lots of effort and intelligence are on display but in execution it is all awkward , static , and lifeless rumblings . 
+1 driven by a fantastic dual performance from ian holm . . . the film is funny , insightfully human and a delightful lark for history buffs . 
+1 a miniscule little bleep on the film radar , but one that many more people should check out
+1 the fly-on-the-wall method used to document rural french school life is a refreshing departure from the now more prevalent technique of the docu-makers being a visible part of their work . 
-1 solondz is without doubt an artist of uncompromising vision , but that vision is beginning to feel , if not morally bankrupt , at least terribly monotonous . 
-1 90 punitive minutes of eardrum-dicing gunplay , screeching-metal smashups , and flaccid odd-couple sniping . 
-1 [green is] the comedy equivalent of saddam hussein , and i'm just about ready to go to the u . n . and ask permission for a preemptive strike . 
-1 the screenplay , co-written by director imogen kimmel , lacks the wit necessary to fully exploit the comic elements of the premise , making the proceedings more bizarre than actually amusing . 
-1 too close to phantom menace for comfort . 
-1 as it stands , there's some fine sex onscreen , and some tense arguing , but not a whole lot more . 
-1 tsai may be ploughing the same furrow once too often . 
+1 a tender and touching drama , based on the true story of a troubled african-american's quest to come to terms with his origins , reveals the yearning we all have in our hearts for acceptance within the family circle . 
+1 if the message seems more facile than the earlier films , the images have such a terrible beauty you may not care . 
-1 though howard demonstrates a great eye as a director , this southern gothic drama is sadly a tough sit , with an undeveloped narrative and enough flashbacks and heavy-handed metaphors to choke a horse -- or at least slow him down to a canter . 
+1 twenty years later , e . t . is still a cinematic touchstone . 
-1 may cause you to bite your tongue to keep from laughing at the ridiculous dialog or the oh-so convenient plot twists . 
+1 this odd , poetic road movie , spiked by jolts of pop music , pretty much takes place in morton's ever-watchful gaze -- and it's a tribute to the actress , and to her inventive director , that the journey is such a mesmerizing one . 
+1 one of those exceedingly rare films in which the talk alone is enough to keep us involved . 
-1 it's just plain boring . 
+1 although the level of the comedy declines as the movie proceeds , there's no denying the fun of watching de niro and crystal having fun . 
+1 the sight of the spaceship on the launching pad is duly impressive in imax dimensions , as are shots of the astronauts floating in their cabins . 
-1 it's hard to know whether or not to recommend this film because for every thing it does right there's at least one and occasionally two things it gets ever so wrong . 
-1 femme fatale offers nothing more than a bait-and-switch that is beyond playing fair with the audience . are we dealing with dreams , visions or being told what actually happened as if it were the third ending of clue ? 
-1 a wretched movie that reduces the second world war to one man's quest to find an old flame . 
-1 this is a third-person story now , told by hollywood , and much more ordinary for it . 
+1 this version moves beyond the original's nostalgia for the communal film experiences of yesteryear to a deeper realization of cinema's inability to stand in for true , lived experience . 
-1 much of what is meant to be 'inspirational' and 'uplifting' is simply distasteful to audiences not already sharing [the movie's] mindset . 
+1 beautifully shot , delicately scored and powered by a set of heartfelt performances , it's a lyrical endeavour . 
-1 whatever about warning kids about the dangers of ouija boards , someone should dispense the same advice to film directors . 
+1 a meatier deeper beginning and/or ending would have easily tipped this film into the " a " range , as is , it's a very very strong " b+ . " i love the robust middle of this picture . 
-1 it's clotted with heavy-handed symbolism , dime-store psychology and endless scenic shots that make 105 minutes seem twice as long . 
-1 presents nothing special and , until the final act , nothing overtly disagreeable . 
-1  " one look at a girl in tight pants and big tits and you turn stupid ? " um . . isn't that the basis for the entire plot ? 
-1 theological matters aside , the movie is so clumsily sentimental and ineptly directed it may leave you speaking in tongues . 
-1 not good enough to pass for a litmus test of the generation gap and not bad enough to repulse any generation of its fans . 
-1 it's hard to tell with all the crashing and banging where the salesmanship ends and the movie begins . 
+1 an uneven but intriguing drama that is part homage and part remake of the italian masterpiece . 
-1 replacing john carpenter's stylish tracking shots is degraded , handheld blair witch video-cam footage . of all the halloween's , this is the most visually unappealing . 
+1 if no one singles out any of these performances as award-worthy , it's only because we would expect nothing less from this bunch . 
+1 the primitive force of this film seems to bubble up from the vast collective memory of the combatants . it's like watching a nightmare made flesh .

-1 there's a reason why halftime is only fifteen minutes long . 
+1 tells a fascinating , compelling story . 
+1 there is a strong directorial stamp on every frame of this stylish film that is able to visualize schizophrenia but is still confident enough to step back and look at the sick character with a sane eye . 
-1  . . . unlikable , uninteresting , unfunny , and completely , utterly inept . 
+1 once again , director jackson strikes a rewarding balance between emotion on the human scale and action/effects on the spectacular scale . 
+1 an interesting look behind the scenes of chicago-based rock group wilco . . . 
+1 an effectively creepy , fear-inducing ( not fear-reducing ) film from japanese director hideo nakata , who takes the superstitious curse on chain letters and actually applies it . 
+1 while bollywood/hollywood will undoubtedly provide its keenest pleasures to those familiar with bombay musicals , it also has plenty for those ( like me ) who aren't . 
+1 the picture's fascinating byways are littered with trenchant satirical jabs at the peculiar egocentricities of the acting breed . 
+1 not the kind of film that will appeal to a mainstream american audience , but there is a certain charm about the film that makes it a suitable entry into the fest circuit . 
+1 although what time offers tsai's usual style and themes , it has a more colorful , more playful tone than his other films . 
-1 a prison comedy that never really busts out of its comfy little cell . 
+1 not only better than its predecessor , it may rate as the most magical and most fun family fare of this or any recent holiday season . 
-1 kwan makes the mix-and- match metaphors intriguing , while lulling us into torpor with his cultivated allergy to action . 
+1 old-form moviemaking at its best . 
-1 oft-described as the antidote to american pie-type sex comedies , it actually has a bundle in common with them , as the film diffuses every opportunity for a breakthrough
+1 sometimes , nothing satisfies like old-fashioned swashbuckling . and in this regard , on guard delivers . 
+1 windtalkers celebrates the human spirit and packs an emotional wallop . 
-1 eight legged freaks falls flat as a spoof . 
-1  . . . standard guns versus martial arts cliche with little new added . 
+1 bourne , jason bourne . he can scale a building like a super hero , he can out-stealth any agent , he'll get the girl . he's super spy ! 
+1 this film seems thirsty for reflection , itself taking on adolescent qualities . 
+1 there has to be a few advantages to never growing old . like being able to hit on a 15-year old when you're over 100 . 
-1  . . . an unimaginative , nasty , glibly cynical piece of work . 
+1 this chicago has hugely imaginative and successful casting to its great credit , as well as one terrific score and attitude to spare . 
-1 a negligible british comedy . 
+1 the subtitled costume drama is set in a remote african empire before cell phones , guns , and the internal combustion engine , but the politics that thump through it are as timely as tomorrow . 
-1 cloaks a familiar anti-feminist equation ( career - kids = misery ) in tiresome romantic-comedy duds . 
-1 its juxtaposition of overwrought existentialism and stomach-churning gore will have you forever on the verge of either cracking up or throwing up . 
-1 one of the worst movies of the year . 
+1 offers the flash of rock videos fused with solid performances and eerie atmosphere . 
+1 gives everyone something to shout about . 
-1 borrows from other movies like it in the most ordinary and obvious fashion . 
+1 it's like rocky and bullwinkle on speed , but that's neither completely enlightening , nor does it catch the intensity of the movie's strangeness . 
-1 nothing more than an amiable but unfocused bagatelle that plays like a loosely-connected string of acting-workshop exercises . 
+1 it's good , hard-edged stuff , violent and a bit exploitative but also nicely done , morally alert and street-smart . 
-1 the attempt is courageous , even if the result is wildly uneven . 
+1 crackerjack entertainment -- nonstop romance , music , suspense and action . 
+1 real women have curves wears its empowerment on its sleeve but even its worst harangues are easy to swallow thanks to remarkable performances by ferrera and ontiveros . 
-1 a one-trick pony whose few t&a bits still can't save itself from being unoriginal , unfunny and unrecommendable . 
-1 the exclamation point seems to be the only bit of glee you'll find in this dreary mess . 
-1 while certain cues , like the happy music , suggest that this movie is supposed to warm our hearts , jeong-hyang lee's film is just as likely to blacken that organ with cold vengefulness . 
-1 it's tough , astringent , darkly funny and . . . well , it's also generic , untidy , condescending and mild of impact rather than stunning . 
-1 it's clear why deuces wild , which was shot two years ago , has been gathering dust on mgm's shelf . 
+1 when compared to the usual , more somber festival entries , davis' highly personal brand of romantic comedy is a tart , smart breath of fresh air that stands out from the pack even if the picture itself is somewhat problematic . 
-1 do you say " hi " to your lover when you wake up in the morning ? 
-1 a laughable -- or rather , unlaughable -- excuse for a film . 
+1 it may not be a great piece of filmmaking , but its power comes from its soul's-eye view of how well-meaning patronizing masked a social injustice , at least as represented by this case . 
+1 while the glass slipper doesn't quite fit , pumpkin is definitely a unique modern fairytale . 
-1 at some point , all this visual trickery stops being clever and devolves into flashy , vaguely silly overkill . 
+1 [cuarón has] created a substantive movie out of several cliched movie structures : the road movie , the coming-of-age movie , and the teenage sex comedy . 
+1 family fare . 
+1 it's rare to find a film to which the adjective 'gentle' applies , but the word perfectly describes pauline & paulette . 
-1 this off-putting french romantic comedy is sure to test severely the indulgence of fans of amélie . 
+1 the most audacious , outrageous , sexually explicit , psychologically probing , pure libido film of the year has arrived from portugal . 
-1 that frenetic spectacle [on the tv show] has usually been leavened by a charm that's conspicuously missing from the girls' big-screen blowout . 
-1 skins has a right to yawp , and we have a right to our grains of salt . 
-1 self-congratulatory , misguided , and ill-informed , if nonetheless compulsively watchable . 
+1 we root for [clara and paul] , even like them , though perhaps it's an emotion closer to pity . 
+1 a giggle-inducing comedy with snappy dialogue and winning performances by an unlikely team of oscar-winners : susan sarandon and goldie hawn . 
+1 all the performances are top notch and , once you get through the accents , all or nothing becomes an emotional , though still positive , wrench of a sit . 
+1 behan himself knew how to spin a tale and one can't help but think he'd appreciate this attempt to turn his life into art . 
-1 it's mighty tedious for the viewer who has to contend with unpleasant characters , hit-and-miss performances and awkwardly staged scenes . 
+1 with wit and empathy to spare , waydowntown acknowledges the silent screams of workaday inertia but stops short of indulging its characters' striving solipsism . 
-1 when perry fists a bull at the moore farm , it's only a matter of time before he gets the upper hand in matters of the heart . 
+1 the storytelling may be ordinary , but the cast is one of those all-star reunions that fans of gosford park have come to assume is just another day of brit cinema . 
+1 the strong subject matter continues to shock throughout the film . not everyone will play the dark , challenging tune taught by the piano teacher . 
-1 like a grinning jack o' lantern , its apparent glee is derived from a lobotomy , having had all its vital essence scooped out and discarded . 
-1 the film didn't move me one way or the other , but it was an honest effort and if you want to see a flick about telemarketers this one will due . 
+1 nothing is sacred in this gut-buster . 
+1 a very good film sits in the place where a masterpiece should be . 
+1 the film occasionally tries the viewer's patience with slow pacing and a main character who sometimes defies sympathy , but it ultimately satisfies with its moving story . 
+1 it is life affirming and heartbreaking , sweet without the decay factor , funny and sad . 
-1 given the fact that virtually no one is bound to show up at theatres for it , the project should have been made for the tube . 
+1 although it includes a fair share of dumb drug jokes and predictable slapstick , " orange county " is far funnier than it would seem to have any right to be . 
-1 while glover , the irrepressible eccentric of river's edge , dead man and back to the future , is perfect casting for the role , he represents bartleby's main overall flaw . 
+1 it's rare to find a film that dazzles the eye , challenges the brain , and satisfies our lust for fast-paced action , but minority report delivers all that and a whole lot more . 
+1 i just saw this movie . . . well , it's probably not accurate to call it a movie . 
+1 hailed as a clever exercise in neo-hitchcockianism , this clever and very satisfying picture is more accurately chabrolian . 
-1 this is just lazy writing . even kids deserve better . 
+1 turturro is fabulously funny and over the top as a 'very sneaky' butler who excels in the art of impossible disappearing/reappearing acts
+1 it's not the least of afghan tragedies that this noble warlord would be consigned to the dustbin of history . 
+1 a welcome relief from baseball movies that try too hard to be mythic , this one is a sweet and modest and ultimately winning story . 
-1 overall the film feels like a low-budget tv pilot that could not find a buyer to play it on the tube . 
+1  . . . a sweetly affecting story about four sisters who are coping , in one way or another , with life's endgame . 
-1 hardly makes the kind of points egoyan wanted to make , nor does it exist as the kind of monument he wanted to build , to victims whose voices have never gained the ears of the world . 
-1 it's obvious [je-gyu is] trying for poetry ; what he gets instead has all the lyricism of a limerick scrawled in a public restroom . 
+1 with dickens' words and writer-director douglas mcgrath's even-toned direction , a ripping good yarn is told . 
-1 some movies can get by without being funny simply by structuring the scenes as if they were jokes : a setup , delivery and payoff . stealing harvard can't even do that much . each scene immediately succumbs to gravity and plummets to earth . 
-1 zaidan's script has barely enough plot to string the stunts together and not quite enough characterization to keep the faces straight . 
+1 a delightful little film that revels in its own simplicity , mostly martha will leave you with a smile on your face and a grumble in your stomach . 
+1 the stripped-down dramatic constructs , austere imagery and abstract characters are equal parts poetry and politics , obvious at times but evocative and heartfelt . 
+1 the touch is generally light enough and the performances , for the most part , credible . 
+1 [an] absorbing documentary . 
+1 has a solid emotional impact . 
-1 the first fatal attraction was vile enough . do we really need the tiger beat version ? 
-1  " bad " is the operative word for " bad company , " and i don't mean that in a good way . 
+1 a beautifully observed character piece . 
+1 you can sip your vintage wines and watch your merchant ivory productions ; i'll settle for a nice cool glass of iced tea and a jerry bruckheimer flick any day of the week . 
-1 wouldn't it be funny if a bunch of allied soldiers went undercover as women in a german factory during world war ii ? um , no . but here's a movie about it anyway . 
-1 needed a little less bling-bling and a lot more romance . 
-1 all ends well , sort of , but the frenzied comic moments never click . 
-1 whereas last year's exemplary sexy beast seemed to revitalize the british gangster movie , this equally brutal outing merely sustains it . 
+1  " the emperor's new clothes " begins with a simple plan . . . . well , at least that's the plan . 
+1 this new time machine is hardly perfect yet it proves surprisingly serviceable . even at its worst , it's not half-bad . 
-1 overwrought , melodramatic bodice-ripper . 
+1  . . . a lesson in prehistoric hilarity . 
+1 one funny popcorn flick . 
-1 it's sweet , harmless , dumb , occasionally funny and about as compelling as a fishing show . 
-1 seriously , rent the disney version . 
+1 as shaky as the plot is , kaufman's script is still memorable for some great one-liners . 
-1 a big meal of cliches that the talented cast generally chokes on . 
+1 most haunting about " fence " is its conclusion , when we hear the ultimate fate of these girls and realize , much to our dismay , that this really did happen . noyce's greatest mistake is thinking that we needed sweeping , dramatic , hollywood moments to keep us
-1 even die-hard fans of japanese animation . . . will find this one a challenge . 
-1 all of the filmmakers' calculations can't rescue brown sugar from the curse of blandness . 
+1 all but the most persnickety preteens should enjoy this nonthreatening but thrilling adventure . 
-1 a bigger holiday downer than your end-of-year 401 ( k ) statement . 
+1 what's infuriating about full frontal is that it's too close to real life to make sense . what's invigorating about it is that it doesn't give a damn . 
+1 for his first attempt at film noir , spielberg presents a fascinating but flawed look at the near future . 
+1 qutting may be a flawed film , but it is nothing if not sincere . 
+1 a captivating coming-of-age story that may also be the first narrative film to be truly informed by the wireless age . 
+1 invigorating , surreal , and resonant with a rainbow of emotion . 
+1 sayles has a knack for casting , often resurrecting performers who rarely work in movies now . . . and drawing flavorful performances from bland actors . 
+1 this gorgeous epic is guaranteed to lift the spirits of the whole family . 
+1 it is a likable story , told with competence . 
+1 it's up to you to decide whether to admire these people's dedication to their cause or be repelled by their dogmatism , manipulativeness and narrow , fearful view of american life . 
+1 an eye-boggling blend of psychedelic devices , special effects and backgrounds , 'spy kids 2' is a visual treat for all audiences . 
-1 pascale bailly's rom-com provides amélie's audrey tautou with another fabuleux destin -- i . e . , a banal spiritual quest . 
+1 this is a finely written , superbly acted offbeat thriller . 
+1 weird . rewarding . 
-1 though clearly well-intentioned , this cross-cultural soap opera is painfully formulaic and stilted . 
-1 flat , but with a revelatory performance by michelle williams . 
-1 the script falls back on too many tried-and-true shenanigans that hardly distinguish it from the next teen comedy . 
+1 meyjes' provocative film might be called an example of the haphazardness of evil . 
-1 takes one character we don't like and another we don't believe , and puts them into a battle of wills that is impossible to care about and isn't very funny . 
-1 for a movie about the power of poetry and passion , there is precious little of either . 
-1 it's a shame that the storyline and its underlying themes . . . finally seem so impersonal or even shallow . 
-1 please , someone , stop eric schaeffer before he makes another film . 
-1 has its moments , but it's pretty far from a treasure . 
+1 this is a smart movie that knows its classical music , knows its freud and knows its sade . 
+1 garcia and the other actors help make the wobbly premise work . 
+1 a mildly enjoyable if toothless adaptation of a much better book . 
+1 more a load of enjoyable , conan-esque claptrap than the punishing , special-effects soul assaults the mummy pictures represent . 
-1 the film is way too full of itself ; it's stuffy and pretentious in a give-me-an-oscar kind of way . 
-1 despite some strong performances , never rises above the level of a telanovela . 
+1 it's a setup so easy it borders on facile , but keeping the film from cheap-shot mediocrity is its crack cast . 
-1 in comparison to his earlier films it seems a disappointingly thin slice of lower-class london life ; despite the title . . . amounts to surprisingly little . 
+1 despite its flaws , crazy as hell marks an encouraging new direction for la salle . 
+1 in between all the emotional seesawing , it's hard to figure the depth of these two literary figures , and even the times in which they lived . but they fascinate in their recklessness . 
-1 what should have been a cutting hollywood satire is instead about as fresh as last week's issue of variety . 
+1 a jaw-droppingly beautiful work that upends nearly every cliché of japanese animation while delivering a more than satisfactory amount of carnage . 
-1 anyone not into high-tech splatterfests is advised to take the warning literally , and log on to something more user-friendly . 
-1 [a] shapeless blob of desperate entertainment . 
+1 what makes the movie a comedy is the way it avoids the more serious emotions involved . 
-1 when not obscured by the booming bass-heavy soundtrack , the conversation presents the kind of linguistic fumbling not heard since macy gray's game of chinese whispers with mr bean . 
-1 this movie , a certain scene in particular , brought me uncomfortably close to losing my lunch . 
-1 i hated every minute of it . 
-1 directed without the expected flair or imagination by hong kong master john woo , windtalkers airs just about every cliche in the war movie compendium across its indulgent two-hour-and-fifteen-minute length . 
-1 scorsese doesn't give us a character worth giving a damn about . 
+1 bouquet gives a performance that is masterly . 
-1 the scriptwriters are no less a menace to society than the film's characters . 
-1 it's a bizarre curiosity memorable mainly for the way it fritters away its potentially interesting subject matter via a banal script , unimpressive acting and indifferent direction . 
+1 lejos del paraíso es al mismo tiempo una fiesta para los ojos y oídos y un movilizador cuadro de personajes enfrentados a sus propios deseos , miedos y prejuicios . 
+1 it's the type of film about growing up that we don't see often enough these days : realistic , urgent , and not sugarcoated in the least . 
+1 leave it to rohmer , now 82 , to find a way to bend current technique to the service of a vision of the past that is faithful to both architectural glories and commanding open spaces of the city as it was more than two centuries ago . 
-1 parker probably thinks he's shaking up a classic the way kenneth branagh and baz luhrmann have , but this half-hearted messing-about just makes us miss wilde's still-contemporary play . 
+1 it's good to see michael caine whipping out the dirty words and punching people in the stomach again . 
-1 you get the impression that writer and director burr steers knows the territory . . . but his sense of humor has yet to lose the smug self-satisfaction usually associated with the better private schools . 
+1 those who don't entirely 'get' godard's distinctive discourse will still come away with a sense of his reserved but existential poignancy . 
-1 instead of kicking off the intrigue and suspense and mystery of the whole thing , hart's war , like the st . louis rams in the super bowl , waits until after halftime to get started . 
-1 newcomer helmer kevin donovan is hamstrung by a badly handled screenplay of what is really an amusing concept  a high-tech tux that transforms its wearer into a superman . 
-1 with a tighter editorial process and firmer direction this material could work , especially since the actresses in the lead roles are all more than competent , but as is , personal velocity seems to be idling in neutral . 
+1 it was filled with shootings , beatings , and more cussing than you could shake a stick at . 
-1 has all the right elements but completely fails to gel together . 
-1 what we get in feardotcom is more like something from a bad clive barker movie . in other words , it's badder than bad . 
-1 the santa clause 2 is a barely adequate babysitter for older kids , but i've got to give it thumbs down . 
-1 they kept much of the plot but jettisoned the stuff that would make this a moving experience for people who haven't read the book . 
+1 parts of the film feel a bit too much like an infomercial for ram dass's latest book aimed at the boomer demographic . but mostly it's a work that , with humor , warmth , and intelligence , captures a life interestingly lived . 
+1 an invaluable historical document thanks to the filmmaker's extraordinary access to massoud , whose charm , cultivation and devotion to his people are readily apparent . 
+1 a gentle , compassionate drama about grief and healing . 
+1 though it runs 163 minutes , safe conduct is anything but languorous . it's packed to bursting with incident , and with scores of characters , some fictional , some from history . 
-1 i'm sure if you're a hartley fan , you might enjoy yourself . . . me , i didn't care for it . 
+1 a witty , whimsical feature debut . 
+1 light , silly , photographed with colour and depth , and rather a good time . 
-1 an afterschool special without the courage of its convictions . 
-1 twenty years later , reggio still knows how to make a point with poetic imagery , but his ability to startle has been stifled by the very prevalence of the fast-forward technology that he so stringently takes to task . 
-1 more precious than perspicacious
-1 god is great , the movie's not . 
+1 the kind of sweet-and-sour insider movie that film buffs will eat up like so much gelati . 
+1 it may be a somewhat backhanded compliment to say that the film makes the viewer feel like the movie's various victimized audience members after a while , but it also happens to be the movie's most admirable quality
+1 'easily my choice for one of the year's best films . '
+1 it's too harsh to work as a piece of storytelling , but as an intellectual exercise -- an unpleasant debate that's been given the drive of a narrative and that's been acted out -- the believer is nothing less than a provocative piece of work . 
+1 jolting into charleston rhythms , the story has the sizzle of old news that has finally found the right vent ( accurate ? who cares ? ) . 
-1 mr . wollter and ms . seldhal give strong and convincing performances , but neither reaches into the deepest recesses of the character to unearth the quaking essence of passion , grief and fear . 
+1 the most compelling performance of the year adds substantial depth to this shocking testament to anti-semitism and neo-fascism . 
+1 dazzling in its complexity , disturbing for its extraordinary themes , the piano teacher is a film that defies categorisation . it haunts , horrifies , startles and fascinates ; it is impossible to look away . ah yes , and then there's the music . . . 
-1 inconsequential road-and-buddy pic . 
-1 there's an admirable rigor to jimmy's relentless anger , and to the script's refusal of a happy ending , but as those monologues stretch on and on , you realize there's no place for this story to go but down . 
-1 a baffling mixed platter of gritty realism and magic realism with a hard-to-swallow premise . 
+1 stevenson's performance is at once clueless and fiercely committed , a volatile combination . 
+1 the characters are more deeply thought through than in most 'right-thinking' films . 
-1 doesn't add up to much . 
+1 an enjoyable film for the family , amusing and cute for both adults and kids . 
+1 not as good as the full monty , but a really strong second effort . 
-1 an unsuccessful attempt at a movie of ideas . 
+1 often shocking but ultimately worthwhile exploration of motherhood and desperate mothers . 
+1 it never fails to engage us . 
-1 seemingly a vehicle to showcase the canadian's inane ramblings , stealing harvard is a smorgasbord of soliloquies about nothing delivered by the former mr . drew barrymore . 
+1 charming and witty , it's also somewhat clumsy . 
+1 [allen] manages to breathe life into this somewhat tired premise . 
+1 bravo for history rewritten , and for the uncompromising knowledge that the highest power of all is the power of love . 
-1 the acting by the over-25s lacks spark , with csokas particularly unconnected . 
+1 marvelously entertaining and deliriously joyous documentary . 
-1 labute was more fun when his characters were torturing each other psychologically and talking about their genitals in public . 
-1 it is a comedy that's not very funny and an action movie that is not very thrilling ( and an uneasy alliance , at that ) . 
-1 one of those movies where you walk out of the theater not feeling cheated exactly , but feeling pandered to , which , in the end , might be all the more infuriating . 
-1 the film didn't convince me that calvin jr . 's barbershop represents some sort of beacon of hope in the middle of chicago's south side . 
-1 cox is far more concerned with aggrandizing madness , not the man , and the results might drive you crazy . 
+1  . . . as the story congeals you feel the pieces of the star wars saga falling into place in a way that makes your spine tingle with revelation and excitement . 
-1 rifkin no doubt fancies himself something of a hubert selby jr . , but there isn't an ounce of honest poetry in his entire script ; it's simply crude and unrelentingly exploitative . 
-1 a vile , incoherent mess . . . a scummy ripoff of david cronenberg's brilliant 'videodrome . '
+1 it isn't that the picture is unfamiliar , but that it manages to find new avenues of discourse on old problems . 
-1 the talented and clever robert rodriguez perhaps put a little too much heart into his first film and didn't reserve enough for his second . 
+1 this is a happy throwback to the time when cartoons were cinema's most idiosyncratic form instead of one of its most predictable . 
-1  . . . too sappy for its own good . 
+1 one of the most genuinely sweet films to come along in quite some time . 
+1 the storylines are woven together skilfully , the magnificent swooping aerial shots are breathtaking , and the overall experience is awesome . 
+1 for decades we've marveled at disney's rendering of water , snow , flames and shadows in a hand-drawn animated world . prepare to marvel again . 
+1 a superbly acted and funny/gritty fable of the humanizing of one woman at the hands of the unseen forces of fate . 
-1 a rehash of every gangster movie from the past decade . 
+1 this is a raw and disturbing tale that took five years to make , and the trio's absorbing narrative is a heart-wrenching showcase indeed . 
-1 while serving sara does have a long way to go before it reaches the level of crudity in the latest austin powers extravaganza , there's nothing here to match that movie's intermittent moments of inspiration . 
+1 it's up to [watts] to lend credibility to this strange scenario , and her presence succeeds in making us believe . 
-1 it's all gratuitous before long , as if schwentke were fulfilling a gross-out quota for an anticipated audience demographic instead of shaping the material to fit the story . 
+1 mr . spielberg and his company just want you to enjoy yourselves without feeling conned . and they succeed merrily at their noble endeavor . 
+1 it represents better-than-average movie-making that doesn't demand a dumb , distracted audience . 
+1 the filmmakers skillfully evoke the sense of menace that nature holds for many urban dwellers . 
-1 all the small moments and flashbacks don't add up to much more than trite observations on the human condition . 
-1 its weighty themes are too grave for youngsters , but the story is too steeped in fairy tales and other childish things to appeal much to teenagers . 
+1 we learn a lot about dying coral and see a lot of life on the reef . 
+1 sound the trumpets : for the first time since desperately seeking susan , madonna doesn't suck as an actress . 
-1 imagine the james woods character from videodrome making a home movie of audrey rose and showing it to the kid from the sixth sense and you've imagined the ring . 
+1 a dreadful day in irish history is given passionate , if somewhat flawed , treatment . 
-1 john carlen's script is full of unhappy , two-dimensional characters who are anything but compelling . 
+1 a classy item by a legend who may have nothing left to prove but still has the chops and drive to show how its done . 
+1 the movie has an infectious exuberance that will engage anyone with a passing interest in the skate/surf culture , the l . a . beach scene and the imaginative ( and sometimes illegal ) ways kids can make a playground out of the refuse of adults . 
-1 you've already seen heartbreak if you've watched the far superior nurse betty or sunset boulevard . even the unwatchable soapdish is more original . 
+1 an ironic speculation on democracy in a culture unaccustomed to it . 
+1 the film's gamble to occasionally break up the live-action scenes with animated sequences pays off , as does its sensitive handling of some delicate subject matter . 
+1  " me without you " is a probing examination of a female friendship set against a few dynamic decades . 
+1 what bloody sunday lacks in clarity , it makes up for with a great , fiery passion . 
+1 maintains your sympathy for this otherwise challenging soul by letting you share her one-room world for a while . 
+1 while tattoo borrows heavily from both seven and the silence of the lambs , it manages to maintain both a level of sophisticated intrigue and human-scale characters that suck the audience in . 
-1 it doesn't do the original any particular dishonor , but neither does it exude any charm or personality . 
+1 the film is beautifully mounted , but , more to the point , the issues are subtly presented , managing to walk a fine line with regard to the question of joan's madness . 
-1 a clichéd and shallow cautionary tale about the hard-partying lives of gay men . 
+1 a candid and often fascinating documentary about a pentecostal church in dallas that assembles an elaborate haunted house each year to scare teenagers into attending services . 
-1 if somebody was bored and . . . decided to make a dull , pretentious version of jesus' son , they'd come up with something like bart freundlich's world traveler . 
+1 a tender , heartfelt family drama . 
-1 k-19 exploits our substantial collective fear of nuclear holocaust to generate cheap hollywood tension . 
-1 stealing harvard aspires to comedic grand larceny but stands convicted of nothing more than petty theft of your time . 
+1 in the new release of cinema paradiso , the tale has turned from sweet to bittersweet , and when the tears come during that final , beautiful scene , they finally feel absolutely earned . 
+1 though nijinsky's words grow increasingly disturbed , the film maintains a beguiling serenity and poise that make it accessible for a non-narrative feature . 
-1 the streets , shot by cinematographer michael ballhaus , may be as authentic as they are mean , but it is nearly impossible to care about what happens on them . 
+1 solid , lump-in-the-throat family entertainment that derives its power by sticking to the facts . 
-1 the movie is dawn of the dead crossed with john carpenter's ghosts of mars , with zombies not as ghoulish as the first and trains not as big as the second . 
+1 a psychic journey deep into the very fabric of iranian . . . life . 
+1 the film is a hoot , and is just as good , if not better than much of what's on saturday morning tv especially the pseudo-educational stuff we all can't stand . 
+1 duvall is strong as always . 
-1 paid in full is so stale , in fact , that its most vibrant scene is one that uses clips from brian de palma's scarface . that's a cheat . 
+1 a thoroughly enjoyable , heartfelt coming-of-age comedy . 
+1 you should pay nine bucks for this : because you can hear about suffering afghan refugees on the news and still be unaffected . dramas like this make it human . 
-1 all i can say is fuhgeddaboutit . 
+1 escaping the studio , piccoli is warmly affecting and so is this adroitly minimalist movie . 
+1 well-written , nicely acted and beautifully shot and scored , the film works on several levels , openly questioning social mores while ensnaring the audience with its emotional pull . 
-1 russell lacks the visual panache , the comic touch , and perhaps the budget of sommers's title-bout features . 
-1 the movie quickly drags on becoming boring and predictable . i tried to read the time on my watch . 
+1 impresses as a skillfully assembled , highly polished and professional adaptation . . . just about as chilling and unsettling as 'manhunter' was . 
-1 it's not just the vampires that are damned in queen of the damned -- the viewers will feel they suffer the same fate . 
+1 i was amused and entertained by the unfolding of bielinsky's cleverly constructed scenario , and greatly impressed by the skill of the actors involved in the enterprise . 
-1 to better understand why this didn't connect with me would require another viewing , and i won't be sitting through this one again . . . that in itself is commentary enough . 
+1 a thoughtful , provocative , insistently humanizing film . 
-1 the impulses that produced this project . . . are commendable , but the results are uneven . 
+1 a mix of gritty realism , crisp storytelling and radiant compassion that effortlessly draws you in . 
+1 turns potentially forgettable formula into something strangely diverting . 
-1 everything its title implies , a standard-issue crime drama spat out from the tinseltown assembly line . 
+1 there aren't too many films that can be as simultaneously funny , offbeat and heartwarming ( without a thick shmear of the goo , at least ) , but " elling " manages to do all three quite well , making it one of the year's most enjoyable releases . 
-1  . . . too slow , too boring , and occasionally annoying . 
-1 this is not a jackie chan movie . it's just a movie that happens to have jackie chan in it . and that makes all the difference . 
-1 the only way this supernatural snore-fest could give anyone a case of the frights is if they were put to sleep by the movie and had a nightmare . 
+1 it's burns' visuals , characters and his punchy dialogue , not his plot , that carry waydowntown . 
-1 the latest installment in the pokemon canon , pokemon 4ever is surprising less moldy and trite than the last two , likely because much of the japanese anime is set in a scenic forest where pokemon graze in peace . 
+1 it's enough to watch huppert scheming , with her small , intelligent eyes as steady as any noir villain , and to enjoy the perfectly pitched web of tension that chabrol spins . 
+1 sits uneasily as a horror picture . . . but finds surprising depth in its look at the binds of a small family . 
+1 see it . debate it . remember it . 
-1 while much of the cast has charm -- especially allodi and nolden -- the performers are sunk by the film's primitive approach to the mechanics of comedy . 
-1 if there was ever a movie where the upbeat ending feels like a copout , this is the one . 
-1 since the movie is based on a nicholas sparks best seller , you know death is lurking around the corner , just waiting to spoil things . 
-1 beware the quirky brit-com . they can and will turn on a dime from oddly humorous to tediously sentimental . 
+1 a rich tale of our times , very well told with an appropriate minimum of means . 
-1 even as i valiantly struggled to remain interested , or at least conscious , i could feel my eyelids . . . getting . . . very . . . heavy . . . 
-1 with virtually no interesting elements for an audience to focus on , chelsea walls is a triple-espresso endurance challenge . 
-1 weighted down with slow , uninvolving storytelling and flat acting . 
+1 has the capability of effecting change and inspiring hope . 
+1 it's a bittersweet and lyrical mix of elements . 
-1 the animation is competent , and some of the gags are quite funny , but jonah . . . never shakes the oppressive , morally superior good-for-you quality that almost automatically accompanies didactic entertainment . 
+1 jason patric and ray liotta make for one splendidly cast pair . 
+1 the continued good chemistry between carmen and juni is what keeps this slightly disappointing sequel going , with enough amusing banter -- blessedly curse-free -- to keep both kids and parents entertained . 
-1 what started out as a taut contest of wills between bacon and theron , deteriorates into a protracted and borderline silly chase sequence . 
-1 enduring love but exhausting cinema . 
+1 impossible as it may sound , this film's heart is even more embracing than monty , if only because it accepts nasty behavior and severe flaws as part of the human condition . 
-1 under-rehearsed and lifeless
-1 it's hard to understand why anyone in his right mind would even think to make the attraction a movie . and it's harder still to believe that anyone in his right mind would want to see the it . 
-1 in the end , we are left with something like two ships passing in the night rather than any insights into gay love , chinese society or the price one pays for being dishonest . 
-1 schmaltzy and unfunny , adam sandler's cartoon about hanukkah is numbingly bad , little nicky bad , 10 worst list bad . 
-1 it's refreshing that someone understands the need for the bad boy ; diesel , with his brawny frame and cool , composed delivery , fits the bill perfectly . 
-1 these spiders can outrun a motorcycle and wrap a person in a sticky cocoon in seconds , but they fall short of being interesting or entertaining . 
+1 filmmakers who can deftly change moods are treasures and even marvels . so , too , is this comedy about mild culture clashing in today's new delhi . 
-1 its appeal will probably limited to lds church members and undemanding armchair tourists . 
+1 reign of fire may be little more than another platter of reheated aliens , but it's still pretty tasty . 
+1 for the most part stevens glides through on some solid performances and witty dialogue . 
+1 so unique and stubborn and charismatic that you want it to be better and more successful than it is . 
-1 this overlong infomercial , due out on video before month's end , is tepid and tedious . 
-1  . . . built on the premise that middle-class arkansas consists of monster truck-loving good ol' boys and peroxide blond honeys whose worldly knowledge comes from tv reruns and supermarket tabloids . 
-1 you come away wishing , though , that the movie spent a lot less time trying to make a credible case for reports from the afterlife and a lot more time on the romantic urgency that's at the center of the story . 
+1 the structure is simple , but in its own way , rabbit-proof fence is a quest story as grand as the lord of the rings . 
-1  . . . for all its social and political potential , state property doesn't end up being very inspiring or insightful . 
+1 a rock-solid gangster movie with a fair amount of suspense , intriguing characters and bizarre bank robberies , plus a heavy dose of father-and-son dynamics . 
-1 care deftly captures the wonder and menace of growing up , but he never really embraces the joy of fuhrman's destructive escapism or the grace-in-rebellion found by his characters . 
+1 a solid examination of the male midlife crisis . 
+1 a hip ride into hyper-time , clockstoppers is a lively and enjoyable adventure for all ages at any time . 
+1 it's a wonderful , sobering , heart-felt drama . 
-1 a technical triumph and an extraordinary bore . 
+1 filled with alexandre desplat's haunting and sublime music , the movie completely transfixes the audience . 
+1 not a strike against yang's similarly themed yi yi , but i found what time ? to be more engaging on an emotional level , funnier , and on the whole less detached . 
+1 p . t . anderson understands the grandness of romance and how love is the great equalizer that can calm us of our daily ills and bring out joys in our lives that we never knew were possible . 
-1 serving sara is little more than a mall movie designed to kill time . 
-1 while there's something intrinsically funny about sir anthony hopkins saying 'get in the car , bitch , ' this jerry bruckheimer production has little else to offer
+1 that death is merely a transition is a common tenet in the world's religions . this deeply spiritual film taps into the meaning and consolation in afterlife communications . 
-1 if the last man were the last movie left on earth , there would be a toss-up between presiding over the end of cinema as we know it and another night of delightful hand shadows . 
+1 the wwii drama is well plotted , visually striking and filled with enjoyably complex characters who are never what they first appear . 
-1 i found it slow , predictable and not very amusing . 
+1 it's a great american adventure and a wonderful film to bring to imax . 
+1 harsh , effective documentary on life in the israeli-occupied palestinian territories . 
+1 an imaginative comedy/thriller . 
-1 i didn't laugh . i didn't smile . i survived . 
-1 high crimes carries almost no organic intrigue as a government/ marine/legal mystery , and that's because the movie serves up all of that stuff , nearly subliminally , as the old-hat province of male intrigue . 
-1 flat , misguided comedy . 
+1 what might have been a predictably heartwarming tale is suffused with complexity . 
-1 what kids will discover is a new collectible . what parents will suspect is that they're watching a 76-minute commercial . 
-1 they're going through the motions , but the zip is gone . 
-1 there's a persistent theatrical sentiment and a woozy quality to the manner of the storytelling , which undercuts the devastatingly telling impact of utter loss personified in the film's simple title . 
-1 the acting is fine but the script is about as interesting as a recording of conversations at the wal-mart checkout line . 
-1 it reduces the complexities to bromides and slogans and it gets so preachy-keen and so tub-thumpingly loud it makes you feel like a chump just for sitting through it . 
-1 if you are curious to see the darker side of what's going on with young tv actors ( dawson leery did what ? ! ? ) , or see some interesting storytelling devices , you might want to check it out , but there's nothing very attractive about this movie . 
+1 for all its serious sense of purpose . . . [it] finds a way to lay bare the tragedies of its setting with a good deal of warmth and humor . 
+1 a hypnotic cyber hymn and a cruel story of youth culture . 
+1 shamelessly resorting to pee-related sight gags that might even cause tom green a grimace ; still , myer's energy and the silliness of it all eventually prevail
-1 michele is a such a brainless flibbertigibbet that it's hard to take her spiritual quest at all seriously . 
+1 though its story is only surface deep , the visuals and enveloping sounds of blue crush make this surprisingly decent flick worth a summertime look-see . 
-1 the script covers huge , heavy topics in a bland , surfacey way that doesn't offer any insight into why , for instance , good things happen to bad people . 
+1 if you like quirky , odd movies and/or the ironic , here's a fun one . 
+1 this version incarnates the prophetic book in a way even its exacting author might admire . 
+1 don't plan on the perfect ending , but sweet home alabama hits the mark with critics who escaped from a small town life . 
+1 humorous and heartfelt , douglas mcgrath's version of 'nicholas nickleby' left me feeling refreshed and hopeful . not many movies have that kind of impact on me these days . 
+1 a treat for its depiction on not giving up on dreams when you're a struggling nobody . 
+1 it's a solid movie about people whose lives are anything but . 
-1 mr . wedge and mr . saldanha handle the mix of verbal jokes and slapstick well . their film falters , however , in its adherence to the disney philosophy of required poignancy , a salute that i'd hoped the movie would avoid . 
-1 'god help us , but capra and cooper are rolling over in their graves . '
-1 just like every other seagal movie , only louder and without that silly ponytail . 
+1 recoing's fantastic performance doesn't exactly reveal what makes vincent tick , but perhaps any definitive explanation for it would have felt like a cheat . 
-1 the humor is hinged on the belief that knees in the crotch , elbows in the face and spit in the eye are inherently funny . 
+1 runs on the pure adrenalin of pacino's performance . 
-1 writer-director walter hill and co-writer david giler try to create characters out of the obvious cliches , but wind up using them as punching bags . 
-1 director jay russell stomps in hobnail boots over natalie babbitt's gentle , endearing 1975 children's novel . 
+1 proves that some movie formulas don't need messing with -- like the big-bug movie . 
-1 there is something in full frontal , i guess , about artifice and acting and how it distorts reality for people who make movies and watch them , but like most movie riddles , it works only if you have an interest in the characters you see . 
+1 holy mad maniac in a mask , splat-man ! good old-fashioned slash-and-hack is back ! 
-1 jacquot's rendering of puccini's tale of devotion and double-cross is more than just a filmed opera . in his first stab at the form , jacquot takes a slightly anarchic approach that works only sporadically . 
-1 not at all clear what it's trying to say and even if it were  i doubt it would be all that interesting . 
-1 even with a green mohawk and a sheet of fire-red flame tattoos covering his shoulder , however , kilmer seems to be posing , rather than acting . and that leaves a hole in the center of the salton sea . 
-1 i didn't laugh at the ongoing efforts of cube , and his skinny buddy mike epps , to make like laurel and hardy 'n the hood . 
-1 with nary a glimmer of self-knowledge , [crane] becomes more specimen than character -- and auto focus remains a chilly , clinical lab report . 
-1 such a fine idea for a film , and such a stultifying , lifeless execution . 
+1 able to provide insight into a fascinating part of theater history . 
-1 the cold turkey would've been a far better title . 
+1 fontaine masterfully creates a portrait of two strong men in conflict , inextricably entwined through family history , each seeing himself in the other , neither liking what he sees . 
+1 the movie should jolt you out of your seat a couple of times , give you a few laughs , and leave you feeling like it was worth your seven bucks , even though it does turn out to be a bit of a cheat in the end . 
-1 the director has injected self-consciousness into the proceedings at every turn . the results are far more alienating than involving . 
+1 it's a sweet , laugh-a-minute crowd pleaser that lifts your spirits as well as the corners of your mouth . 
-1 this is surely one of the most frantic , virulent and foul-natured christmas season pics ever delivered by a hollywood studio . 
+1 like mike isn't going to make box office money that makes michael jordan jealous , but it has some cute moments , funny scenes , and hits the target audience ( young bow wow fans ) - with nothing but net . 
+1 overall very good for what it's trying to do . 
-1 while benigni ( who stars and co-wrote ) seems to be having a wonderful time , he might be alone in that . 
+1 williams creates a stunning , taxi driver-esque portrayal of a man teetering on the edge of sanity . 
-1 what ensues are much blood-splattering , mass drug-induced bowel evacuations , and none-too-funny commentary on the cultural distinctions between americans and brits . 
-1 what's next ? the porky's revenge : ultimate edition ? 
+1 watching war photographer , you come to believe that nachtwey hates the wars he shows and empathizes with the victims he reveals . 
-1 toward the end sum of all fears morphs into a mundane '70s disaster flick . 
-1 a dumb movie with dumb characters doing dumb things and you have to be really dumb not to see where this is going . 
-1 children and adults enamored of all things pokemon won't be disappointed . 
+1 the byplay and bickering between the now spy-savvy siblings , carmen ( vega ) and juni ( sabara ) cortez , anchor the film in a very real and amusing give-and-take . 
+1 it is ok for a movie to be something of a sitcom apparatus , if the lines work , the humor has point and the actors are humanly engaged . 
+1 an energetic and engaging film that never pretends to be something it isn't . 
+1 a wonderful character-based comedy . 
-1 the movie isn't painfully bad , something to be 'fully experienced' ; it's just tediously bad , something to be fully forgotten . 
+1 a powerful , chilling , and affecting study of one man's dying fall . 
+1 marshall puts a suspenseful spin on standard horror flick formula . 
-1 cherish would've worked a lot better had it been a short film . 
-1 the story of trouble every day . . . is so sketchy it amounts to little more than preliminary notes for a science-fiction horror film , and the movie's fragmentary narrative style makes piecing the story together frustrating difficult . 
+1 manages to be both hugely entertaining and uplifting . 
-1 the plot meanders from gripping to plodding and back . 
+1 brings together some of the biggest names in japanese anime , with impressive results . 
-1 it's a brilliant , honest performance by nicholson , but the film is an agonizing bore except when the fantastic kathy bates turns up . bravado kathy ! 
+1 a moving story of determination and the human spirit . 
-1 personal velocity ought to be exploring these women's inner lives , but it never moves beyond their surfaces . 
+1 moody , heartbreaking , and filmed in a natural , unforced style that makes its characters seem entirely convincing even when its script is not . 
+1  . . . a rich and intelligent film that uses its pulpy core conceit to probe questions of attraction and interdependence and how the heart accomodates practical needs . it is an unstinting look at a collaboration between damaged people that may or may not qual
-1 strictly a 'guy's film' in the worst sense of the expression . 
+1 daughter from danang is a film that should be seen by all , especially those who aren't aware of , or have forgotten about the unmentioned victims of war . 
-1 as social exposé , skins has its heart in the right place , but that's not much to hang a soap opera on . 
+1 it's no lie -- big fat liar is a real charmer . 
+1 what it lacks in originality it makes up for in intelligence and b-grade stylishness . 
+1 vividly conveys the passion , creativity , and fearlessness of one of mexico's most colorful and controversial artists -- a captivating drama that will speak to the nonconformist in us all . 
+1 the film has the high-buffed gloss and high-octane jolts you expect of de palma , but what makes it transporting is that it's also one of the smartest , most pleasurable expressions of pure movie love to come from an american director in years . 
-1 director shekhar kapur and screenwriters michael schiffer and hossein amini have tried hard to modernize and reconceptualize things , but the barriers finally prove to be too great . 
-1 i firmly believe that a good video game movie is going to show up soon . i also believe that resident evil is not it . 
+1 skip work to see it at the first opportunity . 
+1 an example of quiet , confident craftsmanship that tells a sweet , charming tale of intergalactic friendship . 
+1 forgettable horror -- more gory than psychological -- with a highly satisfying quotient of friday-night excitement and milla power . 
+1 obligada para impotentes , daneses , camareras italianas , profesores de idiomas , y todo aquel que desee una lengua para expresar su amor . 
+1 the paradiso's rusted-out ruin and ultimate collapse during the film's final ( restored ) thirdemotionally belittle a cinema classic . sometimes shorter is better . 
+1 i don't feel the least bit ashamed in admitting that my enjoyment came at the expense of seeing justice served , even if it's a dish that's best served cold . 
-1 seagal ran out of movies years ago , and this is just the proof . 
+1 beautifully crafted and brutally honest , promises offers an unexpected window into the complexities of the middle east struggle and into the humanity of its people . 
+1 an intriguing and entertaining introduction to johnson . 
-1 more successful at relating history than in creating an emotionally complex , dramatically satisfying heroine
-1 nothing happens , and it happens to flat characters . 
+1 the movie does a good job of laying out some of the major issues that we encounter as we journey through life . 
+1 despite its flaws . . . belinsky is still able to create an engaging story that keeps you guessing at almost every turn . 
-1  . . . surprisingly inert for a movie in which the main character travels back and forth between epochs . 
-1 most folks with a real stake in the american sexual landscape will find it either moderately amusing or just plain irrelevant . 
-1 unless you come in to the film with a skateboard under your arm , you're going to feel like you weren't invited to the party . 
+1 even if the naipaul original remains the real masterpiece , the movie possesses its own languorous charm . 
-1 that neither protagonist has a distinguishable condition hardly matters because both are just actory concoctions , defined by childlike dimness and a handful of quirks . 
-1 has its charming quirks and its dull spots . 
-1 millions of dollars heaped upon a project of such vast proportions need to reap more rewards than spiffy bluescreen technique and stylish weaponry . 
-1 an awkward hybrid of genres that just doesn't work . 
+1 the funny thing is , i didn't mind all this contrived nonsense a bit . 
-1 for all the charm of kevin kline and a story that puts old-fashioned values under the microscope , there's something creepy about this movie . 
-1 a generic bloodbath that often becomes laughably unbearable when it isn't merely offensive . 
-1 the attempt to build up a pressure cooker of horrified awe emerges from the simple fact that the movie has virtually nothing to show . 
-1 often lingers just as long on the irrelevant as on the engaging , which gradually turns what time is it there ? into how long is this movie ? 
-1 there's some good material in their story about a retail clerk wanting more out of life , but the movie too often spins its wheels with familiar situations and repetitive scenes . 
-1 the story suffers a severe case of oversimplification , superficiality and silliness . 
-1 a fragile framework upon which to hang broad , mildly fleshed-out characters that seem to have been conjured up only 10 minutes prior to filming . 
-1 knockaround guys plays like a student film by two guys who desperately want to be quentin tarantino when they grow up . but they lack their idol's energy and passion for detail . 
-1 if you're not the target demographic . . . this movie is one long chick-flick slog . 
-1 serving sara should be served an eviction notice at every theater stuck with it . 
+1 if you can tolerate the redneck-versus-blueblood cliches that the film trades in , sweet home alabama is diverting in the manner of jeff foxworthy's stand-up act . 
-1 a small independent film suffering from a severe case of hollywood-itis . 
+1 if you're not into the pokemon franchise , this fourth animated movie in four years won't convert you -- or even keep your eyes open . but fans should have fun meeting a brand-new pokemon called celebi . 
-1 any one episode of the sopranos would send this ill-conceived folly to sleep with the fishes . 
-1 i liked the original short story but this movie , even at an hour and twenty-some minutes , it's too long and it goes nowhere . 
-1 forgettable , if good-hearted , movie . 
-1 there's no way to sort out the mess in our heads and deconstruct where it all went wrong . this is an hour and a half of daydreaming . 
-1 there are some laughs in this movie , but williams' anarchy gets tiresome , the satire is weak . 
+1 peter jackson and company once again dazzle and delight us , fulfilling practically every expectation either a longtime tolkien fan or a movie-going neophyte could want . 
-1 i'm all for the mentally challenged getting their fair shot in the movie business , but surely it doesn't have to be as a collection of keening and self-mutilating sideshow geeks . 
+1 a passionately inquisitive film determined to uncover the truth and hopefully inspire action . 
-1 if oscar had a category called best bad film you thought was going to be really awful but wasn't , guys would probably be duking it out with the queen of the damned for the honor . 
-1 these two are generating about as much chemistry as an iraqi factory poised to receive a un inspector . 
-1 an essentially awkward version of the lightweight female empowerment picture we've been watching for decades
-1 it seems to me the film is about the art of ripping people off without ever letting them consciously know you have done so
-1 the sweetest thing leaves a bitter taste . 
+1 a confluence of kiddie entertainment , sophisticated wit and symbolic graphic design . 
-1 distinctly sub-par . . . more likely to drown a viewer in boredom than to send any shivers down his spine . 
+1 hatosy . . . portrays young brendan with his usual intelligence and subtlety , not to mention a convincing brogue . 
-1  . . . a bland murder-on-campus yawner . 
-1 it has plenty of laughs . it just doesn't have much else . . . especially in a moral sense . 
-1 fluffy and disposible . 
-1 if you think it's a riot to see rob schneider in a young woman's clothes , then you'll enjoy the hot chick . 
+1 there's enough science to make it count as educational , and enough beauty to make it unforgettable . 
+1 the wonderfully lush morvern callar is pure punk existentialism , and ms . ramsay and her co-writer , liana dognini , have dramatized the alan warner novel , which itself felt like an answer to irvine welsh's book trainspotting . 
-1 suffers from a flat script and a low budget . 
+1 it further declares its director , zhang yang of shower , as a boldly experimental , contemporary stylist with a bright future . 
-1  . . . irritating soul-searching garbage . 
-1 even if you're an elvis person , you won't find anything to get excited about on this dvd . 
-1 technically and artistically inept . 
-1 passable enough for a shoot-out in the o . k . court house of life type of flick . strictly middle of the road . 
+1 an appealingly juvenile trifle that delivers its share of laughs and smiles . 
+1 a smart , provocative drama that does the nearly impossible : it gets under the skin of a man we only know as an evil , monstrous lunatic . 
+1 mastering its formidable arithmetic of cameras and souls , group articulates a flood of emotion . 
+1 with an unflappable air of decadent urbanity , everett remains a perfect wildean actor , and a relaxed firth displays impeccable comic skill . 
+1 when it really counts . . . bloody sunday connects on a visceral level that transcends language . 
-1 feels like pieces a bunch of other , better movies slapped together . 
-1  . . . really horrible drek . 
-1 with recent tensions rekindled by the kathleen soliah trial and the upcoming trial of sla members emily and william harris , not to mention sept . 11 , its difficult these days to appreciate fire's bright side . 
-1 the milieu is wholly unconvincing . . . and the histrionics reach a truly annoying pitch . 
-1 an opportunity missed . 
+1 does a good job of establishing a time and place , and of telling a fascinating character's story . 
+1 [the film] tackles the topic of relationships in such a straightforward , emotionally honest manner that by the end , it's impossible to ascertain whether the film is , at its core , deeply pessimistic or quietly hopeful . 
+1 it's endlessly inventive , consistently intelligent and sickeningly savage . 
-1 the camera whirls ! the camera twirls ! oh , look at that clever angle ! wow , a jump cut ! 
-1 ever see one of those comedies that just seem like a bad idea from frame one ? 
-1 do we really need another film that praises female self-sacrifice ? 
-1 plays like a volatile and overlong w magazine fashion spread . 
+1 a great companion piece to other napoleon films . 
-1 not a stereotype is omitted nor a cliché left unsaid . 
+1 it has a subtle way of getting under your skin and sticking with you long after it's over . 
-1 the ending doesn't work . . . but most of the movie works so well i'm almost recommending it , anyway -- maybe not to everybody , but certainly to people with a curiosity about how a movie can go very right , and then step wrong . 
-1 frankly , it's pretty stupid . i had more fun with ben stiller's zoolander , which i thought was rather clever . but there's plenty to offend everyone . . . 
-1 despite the holes in the story and the somewhat predictable plot , moments of the movie caused me to jump in my chair . . . 
-1 formulaic to the 51st power , more like .

-1  . . . what a banal bore the preachy circuit turns out to be
+1 has its share of arresting images . 
-1 an awful movie that will only satisfy the most emotionally malleable of filmgoers . 
+1 an extraordinary swedish film about the soul adventure of marriage -- the kind of intimate and character-driven film that bille august does best . 
+1 don't judge this one too soon - it's a dark , gritty story but it takes off in totally unexpected directions and keeps on going . 
+1 like all great films about a life you never knew existed , it offers much to absorb and even more to think about after the final frame . 
-1 brosnan's finest non-bondish performance yet fails to overcome the film's manipulative sentimentality and annoying stereotypes . 
+1 although occasionally static to the point of resembling a stage play , the film delivers a solid mixture of sweetness and laughs . 
+1 they crush each other under cars , throw each other out windows , electrocute and dismember their victims in full consciousness . and we don't avert our eyes for a moment . 
-1 none of the characters or plot-lines are fleshed-out enough to build any interest . 
-1 writer-director randall wallace has bitten off more than he or anyone else could chew , and his movie veers like a drunken driver through heavy traffic . 
-1 it's just too bad the screenwriters eventually shoot themselves in the feet with cop flick cliches like an oily arms dealer , squad car pile-ups and the requisite screaming captain . 
-1 characters wander into predictably treacherous situations even though they should know better . 
-1 seems content to dog-paddle in the mediocre end of the pool , and it's a sad , sick sight . 
-1 downright transparent is the script's endless assault of embarrassingly ham-fisted sex jokes that reek of a script rewrite designed to garner the film a " cooler " pg-13 rating . 
+1 a comprehensive and provocative film -- one that pushes the boundaries of biography , and challenges its audience . 
+1 kids five and up will be delighted with the fast , funny , and even touching story . parents may even find that it goes by quickly , because it has some of the funniest jokes of any movie this year , including those intended for adults . 
-1 gere gives a good performance in a film that doesn't merit it . 
-1 director carl franklin , so crisp and economical in one false move , bogs down in genre cliches here . 
-1 all ms . jovovich , as the sanctified heroine , has to do is look radiant , grimly purposeful and mildly alarmed while forcing open doors , wielding wrenches and fleeing monsters . 
-1 [a] soulless , stupid sequel . . . 
+1 your children will be occupied for 72 minutes . 
+1 exquisitely nuanced in mood tics and dialogue , this chamber drama is superbly acted by the deeply appealing veteran bouquet and the chilling but quite human berling . 
+1 the best comedy concert movie i've seen since cho's previous concert comedy film , i'm the one that i want , in 2000 . 
+1 warm water under a red bridge is a quirky and poignant japanese film that explores the fascinating connections between women , water , nature , and sexuality . 
+1 neatly constructed thriller . 
-1 it's drab . it's uninteresting . it squanders chan's uniqueness ; it could even be said to squander jennifer love hewitt ! 
-1 a boring , formulaic mix of serial killers and stalk'n'slash . 
+1 writer/director joe carnahan's grimy crime drama is a manual of precinct cliches , but it moves fast enough to cover its clunky dialogue and lapses in logic . 
-1 screenwriter dan schneider and director shawn levy substitute volume and primary colors for humor and bite . 
-1  . . . post-september 11 , " the sum of all fears " seems more tacky and reprehensible , manipulating our collective fear without bestowing the subject with the intelligence or sincerity it unequivocally deserves . 
-1 although huppert's intensity and focus has a raw exhilaration about it , the piano teacher is anything but fun . 
+1 peter jackson has done the nearly impossible . he has improved upon the first and taken it a step further , richer and deeper . what jackson has done is proven that no amount of imagination , no creature , no fantasy story and no incredibly outlandish scenery
-1 eccentric enough to stave off doldrums , caruso's self-conscious debut is also eminently forgettable . 
-1 [lee] treats his audience the same way that jim brown treats his women -- as dumb , credulous , unassuming , subordinate subjects . and lee seems just as expectant of an adoring , wide-smiling reception . 
-1 a well-crafted letdown . 
-1 with a story as bizarre and mysterious as this , you don't want to be worrying about whether the ineffectual broomfield is going to have the courage to knock on that door . 
+1 it's light on the chills and heavy on the atmospheric weirdness , and there are moments of jaw-droppingly odd behavior -- yet i found it weirdly appealing . 
-1 what starts off as a potentially incredibly twisting mystery becomes simply a monster chase film . 
+1 buy is an accomplished actress , and this is a big , juicy role . 
-1 something must have been lost in the translation . 
+1 bloody sunday has the grace to call for prevention rather than to place blame , making it one of the best war movies ever made . it's a movie that accomplishes so much that one viewing can't possibly be enough . 
+1 as expected , sayles' smart wordplay and clever plot contrivances are as sharp as ever , though they may be overshadowed by some strong performances . 
-1 press the delete key . 
-1 some decent actors inflict big damage upon their reputations . 
+1 compassionately explores the seemingly irreconcilable situation between conservative christian parents and their estranged gay and lesbian children . 
+1 a gem of a romantic crime comedy that turns out to be clever , amusing and unpredictable . 
+1 the simplicity of the way home has few equals this side of aesop
-1 aan opportunity wasted . 
+1 this is an extraordinary film , not least because it is japanese and yet feels universal . 
+1 in a way , the film feels like a breath of fresh air , but only to those that allow it in . 
+1 grant carries the day with impeccable comic timing , raffish charm and piercing intellect . 
-1 sensitive though not quite revelatory documentary . 
+1 what makes salton sea surprisingly engrossing is that caruso takes an atypically hypnotic approach to a world that's often handled in fast-edit , hopped-up fashion . 
+1 with tightly organized efficiency , numerous flashbacks and a constant edge of tension , miller's film is one of 2002's involvingly adult surprises . 
+1 this is as respectful a film as byatt fans could hope for , though lovers of the book may wonder why it's necessary . 
+1 while its careful pace and seemingly opaque story may not satisfy every moviegoer's appetite , the film's final scene is soaringly , transparently moving . 
-1 aloof and lacks any real raw emotion , which is fatal for a film that relies on personal relationships . 
-1 a glossy knock-off of a b-movie revenge flick . 
+1 never lets go your emotions , taking them to surprising highs , sorrowful lows and hidden impulsive niches . . . gorgeous , passionate , and at times uncommonly moving . 
+1 sad to say -- it accurately reflects the rage and alienation that fuels the self-destructiveness of many young people . 
+1 it's not so much enjoyable to watch as it is enlightening to listen to new sides of a previous reality , and to visit with some of the people who were able to make an impact in the theater world . 
+1  " the mothman prophecies " is a difficult film to shake from your conscience when night falls . 
+1 rifkin's references are . . . impeccable throughout .

-1  . . . pitiful , slapdash disaster . a doa dud from frame one . 
+1 the film has a laundry list of minor shortcomings , but the numerous scenes of gory mayhem are worth the price of admission . . . if " gory mayhem " is your idea of a good time . 
+1 an almost unbearably morbid love story . 
+1 the film jolts the laughs from the audience--as if by cattle prod . 
-1 in his determination to lighten the heavy subject matter , silberling also , to a certain extent , trivializes the movie with too many nervous gags and pratfalls . 
+1 frida's artistic brilliance is undeniable -- it's among the most breathtakingly designed films i've ever seen . 
-1 little more than a well-mounted history lesson . 
-1 the isolated moments of creative insanity finally are lost in the thin soup of canned humor . 
+1 graced with the kind of social texture and realism that would be foreign in american teen comedies . 
-1 there's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there's nothing else happening . 
-1 with its hints of a greater intelligence lurking somewhere , the ring makes its stupidity more than obvious . it's painful . 
-1 a reworking of die hard and cliffhanger but it's nowhere near as exciting as either . 
-1 it just didn't mean much to me and played too skewed to ever get a hold on ( or be entertained by ) . 
+1 as ex-marine walter , who may or may not have shot kennedy , actor raymond j . barry is perfectly creepy and believable . 
-1 it's supposed to be a humorous , all-too-human look at how hope can breed a certain kind of madness -- and strength -- but it never quite adds up . 
+1 dong shows how intolerance has the power to deform families , then tear them apart . 
-1 this re-do is so dumb and so exploitative in its violence that , ironically , it becomes everything that the rather clumsy original was railing against . 
+1 beautifully shot against the frozen winter landscapes of grenoble and geneva , the film unfolds with all the mounting tension of an expert thriller , until the tragedy beneath it all gradually reveals itself . 
-1 with minimal imagination , you could restage the whole thing in your bathtub . 
+1 thanks to scott's charismatic roger and eisenberg's sweet nephew , roger dodger is one of the most compelling variations on in the company of men . 
-1 it's super- violent , super-serious and super-stupid . 
-1 one of these days hollywood will come up with an original idea for a teen movie , but until then there's always these rehashes to feed to the younger generations . 
+1 from both a great and a terrible story , mr . nelson has made a film that is an undeniably worthy and devastating experience . 
+1 rouge is less about a superficial midlife crisis than it is about the need to stay in touch with your own skin , at 18 or 80 . 
+1 this masterfully calibrated psychological thriller thrives on its taut performances and creepy atmosphere even if the screenplay falls somewhat short . 
+1 doug liman , the director of bourne , directs the traffic well , gets a nice wintry look from his locations , absorbs us with the movie's spycraft and uses damon's ability to be focused and sincere . 
+1 an indispensable peek at the art and the agony of making people laugh . 
-1 vaguely interesting , but it's just too too much . 
+1 a beautiful , timeless and universal tale of heated passions -- jealousy , betrayal , forgiveness and murder . 
-1 while it may not add up to the sum of its parts , holofcener's film offers just enough insight to keep it from being simpleminded , and the ensemble cast is engaging enough to keep you from shifting in your chair too often . 
+1 'frailty " starts out like a typical bible killer story , but it turns out to be significantly different ( and better ) than most films with this theme . 
+1 there's plenty to impress about e . t . 
-1 the trappings of i spy are so familiar you might as well be watching a rerun . 
-1 this is an action movie with an action icon who's been all but decommissioned . 
+1 miller tells this very compelling tale with little fuss or noise , expertly plucking tension from quiet . 
+1 a sly dissection of the inanities of the contemporary music business and a rather sad story of the difficulties of artistic collaboration . 
+1 if you come from a family that eats , meddles , argues , laughs , kibbitzes and fights together , then go see this delightful comedy . 
+1 engages us in constant fits of laughter , until we find ourselves surprised at how much we care about the story , and end up walking out not only satisfied but also somewhat touched . 
-1 mib ii is a movie that makes it possible for the viewer to doze off for a few minutes or make several runs to the concession stand and/or restroom and not feel as if he or she has missed anything . that's because relatively nothing happens . 
-1 a retread of material already thoroughly plumbed by martin scorsese . 
-1 laconic and very stilted in its dialogue , this indie flick never found its audience , probably because it's extremely hard to relate to any of the characters . 
-1 the film is a confusing melange of tones and styles , one moment a romantic trifle and the next a turgid drama . 
+1 upsetting and thought-provoking , the film has an odd purity that doesn't bring you into the characters so much as it has you study them . 
+1 rich in shadowy metaphor and as sharp as a samurai sword , jiang wen's devils on the doorstep is a wartime farce in the alternately comic and gut-wrenching style of joseph heller or kurt vonnegut . 
-1 nothing but one relentlessly depressing situation after another for its entire running time , something that you could easily be dealing with right now in your lives . 
+1 an extraordinary dramatic experience . 
-1 national lampoon's van wilder may aim to be the next animal house , but it more closely resembles this year's version of tomcats . 
-1 even in the summertime , the most restless young audience deserves the dignity of an action hero motivated by something more than franchise possibilities . 
+1 the best part about " gangs " was daniel day-lewis . 
-1 a story which fails to rise above its disgusting source material . 
-1 a late-night cable sexploitation romp masquerading as a thriller about the ruthless social order that governs college cliques . 
-1 like a soft drink that's been sitting open too long : it's too much syrup and not enough fizz . 
+1 it manages to squeeze by on angelina jolie's surprising flair for self-deprecating comedy . 
-1 the lousy john q all but spits out denzel washington's fine performance in the title role . 
+1 the kind of primal storytelling that george lucas can only dream of . 
+1  . . . an agreeable time-wasting device -- but george pal's low-tech 1960 version still rules the epochs . 
-1 sc2 is an autopilot hollywood concoction lacking in imagination and authentic christmas spirit , yet it's geared toward an audience full of masters of both . 
+1 the film has an infectious enthusiasm and we're touched by the film's conviction that all life centered on that place , that time and that sport . 
-1 it plays like a big-budget , after-school special with a generous cast , who at times lift the material from its well-meaning clunkiness . 
-1 it's the kind of movie that ends up festooning u . s . art house screens for no reason other than the fact that it's in french ( well , mostly ) with english subtitles and is magically 'significant' because of that . 
-1  . . . a mostly boring affair with a confusing sudden finale that's likely to irk viewers . 
+1 about schmidt belongs to nicholson . gone are the flamboyant mannerisms that are the trademark of several of his performances . as schmidt , nicholson walks with a slow , deliberate gait , chooses his words carefully and subdues his natural exuberance . 
+1 this boisterous comedy serves up a cruel reminder of the fate of hundreds of thousands of chinese , one which can only qualify as a terrible tragedy . 
+1 though an important political documentary , this does not really make the case the kissinger should be tried as a war criminal . 
+1 a very charming and funny movie . 
+1 a film that begins with the everyday lives of naval personnel in san diego and ends with scenes so true and heartbreaking that tears welled up in my eyes both times i saw the film . 
+1 american and european cinema has amassed a vast holocaust literature , but it is impossible to think of any film more challenging or depressing than the grey zone .

+1 my little eye is the best little " horror " movie i've seen in years . 
+1 holm . . . embodies the character with an effortlessly regal charisma . 
-1 an ugly , revolting movie . 
+1 from blushing to gushing---imamura squirts the screen in warm water under a red bridge'
-1 stale , futile scenario . 
-1 exactly what it claims to be -- a simple diversion for the kids . 
-1 bad company leaves a bad taste , not only because of its bad-luck timing , but also the staleness of its script . 
-1 follows the original film virtually scene for scene and yet manages to bleed it almost completely dry of humor , verve and fun . 
-1 an occasionally interesting but mostly repetitive look at a slice of counterculture that might be best forgotten . 
-1 the inevitable double- and triple-crosses arise , but the only drama is in waiting to hear how john malkovich's reedy consigliere will pronounce his next line . 
+1 ' . . . the film's considered approach to its subject matter is too calm and thoughtful for agitprop , and the thinness of its characterizations makes it a failure as straight drama . '
+1 allows us to hope that nolan is poised to embark a major career as a commercial yet inventive filmmaker . 
-1 perhaps even the slc high command found writer-director mitch davis's wall of kitsch hard going . 
-1 this isn't a movie ; it's a symptom . 
+1 for all its failed connections , divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood is nurturing , in a gauzy , dithering way . 
-1 a incompetência de marcus adams como roteirista só é superada por sua péssima direção . 
-1 swims in mediocrity , sticking its head up for a breath of fresh air now and then . 
-1 belongs in the too-hot-for-tv direct-to-video/dvd category , and this is why i have given it a one-star rating . 
-1 beyond a handful of mildly amusing lines . . . there just isn't much to laugh at . 
-1 director uwe boll and the actors provide scant reason to care in this crude '70s throwback . 
-1 the film itself is about something very interesting and odd that would probably work better as a real documentary without the insinuation of mediocre acting or a fairly trite narrative . 
-1 in the name of an allegedly inspiring and easily marketable flick , the emperor's club turns a blind eye to the very history it pretends to teach . 
+1 goofy , nutty , consistently funny . and educational ! 
-1 nothing more than a run-of-the-mill action flick . 
-1 normally , rohmer's talky films fascinate me , but when he moves his setting to the past , and relies on a historical text , he loses the richness of characterization that makes his films so memorable . 
-1 a soggy , cliche-bound epic-horror yarn that ends up being even dumber than its title . 
+1 often gruelling and heartbreaking to witness , but seldahl and wollter's sterling performances raise this far above the level of the usual maudlin disease movie . 
+1 the film is delicately narrated by martin landau and directed with sensitivity and skill by dana janklowicz-mann . 
-1 i don't mind having my heartstrings pulled , but don't treat me like a fool . 
+1 although it doesn't always hang together -- violence and whimsy don't combine easily -- " cherish " certainly isn't dull . 
-1 time stands still in more ways that one in clockstoppers , a sci-fi thriller as lazy as it is interminable . 
-1 the title's lameness should clue you in on how bad the movie is . 
-1 there's no palpable chemistry between lopez and male lead ralph fiennes , plus the script by working girl scribe kevin wade is workmanlike in the extreme . 
+1 a comedy that swings and jostles to the rhythms of life . 
+1 with elements cribbed from lang's metropolis , welles' kane , and eisenstein's potemkin , the true wonder of rintarô's metropolis is the number of lasting images all its own . 
+1 in auteil's less dramatic but equally incisive performance , he's a charismatic charmer likely to seduce and conquer . 
+1 spare yet audacious . . . 
+1 the film aims to be funny , uplifting and moving , sometimes all at once . the extent to which it succeeds is impressive . 
-1 this is the case of a pregnant premise being wasted by a script that takes few chances and manages to insult the intelligence of everyone in the audience . 
-1 even those of a single digit age will be able to recognize that this story is too goofy . . . even for disney . 
+1 remains a solid , if somewhat heavy-handed , account of the near-disaster . . . done up by howard with a steady , if not very imaginative , hand . 
-1 it tells more than it shows . 
+1 a sensitive and expertly acted crowd-pleaser that isn't above a little broad comedy and a few unabashedly sentimental tears . 
+1 a perfectly competent and often imaginative film that lacks what little lilo & stitch had in spades -- charisma . 
-1 this dreadfully earnest inversion of the concubine love triangle eschews the previous film's historical panorama and roiling pathos for bug-eyed mugging and gay-niche condescension . 
-1 the film feels formulaic , its plot and pacing typical hollywood war-movie stuff , while the performances elicit more of a sense of deja vu than awe . 
+1 for those in search of something different , wendigo is a genuinely bone-chilling tale . 
+1 it's a brave attempt to tap into the heartbeat of the world , a salute to the universal language of rhythm and a zippy sampling of sounds . 
+1 the reason this picture works better than its predecessors is that myers is no longer simply spoofing the mini-mod-madness of '60s spy movies . 
+1 watching spirited away is like watching an eastern imagination explode . 
-1 there are some fairly unsettling scenes , but they never succeed in really rattling the viewer . 
-1 it's kind of sad that so many people put so much time and energy into this turkey . 
-1 makes the same mistake as the music industry it criticizes , becoming so slick and watered-down it almost loses what made you love it in the first place . 
+1 apesar de seus graves problemas , o filme consegue entreter . 
-1 don't waste your money . 
-1 the story is familiar from its many predecessors ; like them , it eventually culminates in the not-exactly -stunning insight that crime doesn't pay . 
-1 screenwriter chris ver weil's directing debut is good-natured and never dull , but its virtues are small and easily overshadowed by its predictability . 
-1 a showcase for both the scenic splendor of the mountains and for legendary actor michel serrault , the film is less successful on other levels . 
+1 hugely accomplished slice of hitchcockian suspense . 
+1 almodovar is an imaginative teacher of emotional intelligence in this engaging film about two men who discover what william james once called 'the gift of tears . '
-1 rainy days and movies about the disintegration of families always get me down . 
+1 suffers from the lack of a compelling or comprehensible narrative . still , as a visual treat , the film is almost unsurpassed . 
-1 two badly interlocked stories drowned by all too clever complexity . 
+1 a coda in every sense , the pinochet case splits time between a minute-by-minute account of the british court's extradition chess game and the regime's talking-head survivors . 
+1 when twentysomething hotsies make movies about their lives , hard-driving narcissism is a given , but what a world we'd live in if argento's hollywood counterparts . . . had this much imagination and nerve . 
-1 wanders all over the map thematically and stylistically , and borrows heavily from lynch , jeunet , and von trier while failing to find a spark of its own . 
+1 this is art paying homage to art . 
+1 more vaudeville show than well-constructed narrative , but on those terms it's inoffensive and actually rather sweet . 
+1 a sly game of cat and mouse that's intense and thrilling at times , but occasionally stretches believability to its limits and relies on predictable plot contrivances . 
+1 as bundy , michael reilly burke ( octopus 2 : river of fear ) has just the right amount of charisma and menace . 
-1 the dialogue is cumbersome , the simpering soundtrack and editing more so . 
+1 a wonderfully speculative character study that made up for its rather slow beginning by drawing me into the picture . 
+1 it has the courage to wonder about big questions with sincerity and devotion . it risks seeming slow and pretentious , because it thinks the gamble is worth the promise . 
+1 gosling creates a staggeringly compelling character , a young man whose sharp intellect is at the very root of his contradictory , self-hating , self-destructive ways . 
-1 a woozy , roisterous , exhausting mess , and the off-beat casting of its two leads turns out to be as ill-starred as you might expect . 
+1 the movie's thesis -- elegant technology for the masses -- is surprisingly refreshing . 
+1 jeong-hyang lee's film is deceptively simple , deeply satisfying . 
-1 this one aims for the toilet and scores a direct hit . 
-1 except for paymer as the boss who ultimately expresses empathy for bartleby's pain , the performances are so stylized as to be drained of human emotion . 
+1 piercingly affecting . . . while clearly a manipulative film , emerges as powerful rather than cloying . 
-1 the sum of all fears is almost impossible to follow -- and there's something cringe-inducing about seeing an american football stadium nuked as pop entertainment . 
-1 it's so underwritten that you can't figure out just where the other characters , including ana's father and grandfather , come down on the issue of ana's future . 
-1 big fat liar is little more than home alone raised to a new , self-deprecating level . 
-1 an unsophisticated sci-fi drama that takes itself all too seriously . 
+1 it's [ricci's] best work yet , this girl-woman who sincerely believes she can thwart the world's misery with blind good will . 
+1 elegant , mannered and teasing . 
+1 diggs and lathan are among the chief reasons brown sugar is such a sweet and sexy film . 
+1 red dragon makes one appreciate silence of the lambs . 
-1 dilbert without the right-on satiric humor . 
-1 i'm convinced i could keep a family of five blind , crippled , amish people alive in this situation better than these british soldiers do at keeping themselves kicking . 
-1 analyze that regurgitates and waters down many of the previous film's successes , with a few new swings thrown in . 
+1 this time out , [sade] is an unsettlingly familiar figure -- in turns loyal and deceitful , responsible and reckless , idealistically selfless and coldly self-interested . 
-1 it made me feel unclean , and i'm the guy who liked there's something about mary and both american pie movies . oh , and booty call . 
+1 insanely hilarious ! i haven't laughed that hard in years ! 
+1 it proves quite compelling as an intense , brooding character study . 
-1 a grating , emaciated flick . 
+1 you wouldn't want to live waydowntown , but it is a hilarious place to visit . 
-1 i'll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film . 
-1 a morality tale whose thought-provoking potential is hampered by a made-for-tv look , rigid performances and an asinine 'twist' that brazenly rips off the sixth sense . 
-1 the issues are presented in such a lousy way , complete with some of the year's ( unintentionally ) funniest moments , that it's impossible to care . 
-1 both shrill and soporific , and because everything is repeated five or six times , it can seem tiresomely simpleminded . 
+1 this is unusual , food-for-thought cinema that's as entertaining as it is instructive . 
+1 it's the cinematic equivalent of a good page-turner , and even if it's nonsense , its claws dig surprisingly deep . 
-1 i wish windtalkers had had more faith in the dramatic potential of this true story . this would have been better than the fiction it has concocted , and there still could have been room for the war scenes . 
-1 so what is the point ? lovingly choreographed bloodshed taking place in a pristine movie neverland , basically . 
-1 although sensitive to a fault , it's often overwritten , with a surfeit of weighty revelations , flowery dialogue , and nostalgia for the past and roads not taken . 
-1 at best , cletis tout might inspire a trip to the video store -- in search of a better movie experience . 
-1 it's too interested in jerking off in all its byzantine incarnations to bother pleasuring its audience . 
+1 finds a way to tell a simple story , perhaps the simplest story of all , in a way that seems compelling and even original . 
+1 the movie is for fans who can't stop loving anime , and the fanatical excess built into it . 
+1 as a vehicle to savour binoche's skill , the film is well worthwhile . 
-1 it's the element of condescension , as the filmmakers look down on their working-class subjects from their lofty perch , that finally makes sex with strangers , which opens today in the new york metropolitan area , so distasteful . 
+1 coral reef adventure is a heavyweight film that fights a good fight on behalf of the world's endangered reefs -- and it lets the pictures do the punching . 
-1 simone is not a bad film . it just doesn't have anything really interesting to say . 
+1 a cockamamie tone poem pitched precipitously between swoony lyricism and violent catastrophe . . . the most aggressively nerve-wracking and screamingly neurotic romantic comedy in cinema history . 
+1 a deliciously mordant , bitter black comedy . 
-1 one of the more glaring signs of this movie's servitude to its superstar is the way it skirts around any scenes that might have required genuine acting from ms . spears . 
+1 it's a strange film , one that was hard for me to warm up to . 
-1 leaves viewers out in the cold and undermines some phenomenal performances . 
-1 a thoroughly awful movie--dumb , narratively chaotic , visually sloppy . . . a weird amalgam of 'the thing' and a geriatric 'scream . '
+1 for its seriousness , high literary aspirations and stunning acting , the film can only be applauded . 
+1 an enjoyable , if occasionally flawed , experiment . 
-1 the main characters are simply named the husband , the wife and the kidnapper , emphasizing the disappointingly generic nature of the entire effort . 
-1 the problematic characters and overly convenient plot twists foul up shum's good intentions . 
+1 a soap-opera quality twist in the last 20 minutes . . . almost puts the kibosh on what is otherwise a sumptuous work of b-movie imagination . 
+1 there's just something about watching a squad of psychopathic underdogs whale the tar out of unsuspecting lawmen that reaches across time and distance . 
-1 one of those films that started with a great premise and then just fell apart . 
-1 a frantic search for laughs , with a hit-to-miss ratio that doesn't exactly favour the audience . 
+1 a weird , arresting little ride . 
-1 barely manages for but a few seconds over its seemingly eternal running time to pique your interest , your imagination , your empathy or anything , really , save your disgust and your indifference . 
-1 the trouble with making this queen a thoroughly modern maiden is that it also makes her appear foolish and shallow rather than , as was more likely , a victim of mental illness . 
+1 here is a vh1 behind the music special that has something a little more special behind it : music that didn't sell many records but helped change a nation . 
-1 obviously , a lot of people wasted a lot of their time ( including mine ) on something very inconsequential . 
-1 a work that lacks both a purpose and a strong pulse . 
+1 one of the year's most weirdly engaging and unpredictable character pieces . 
-1 starts out strongly before quickly losing its focus , point and purpose in a mess of mixed messages , over-blown drama and bruce willis with a scar . 
-1 this movie is about the worst thing chan has done in the united states . 
+1 it's an interesting effort ( particularly for jfk conspiracy nuts ) , and barry's cold-fish act makes the experience worthwhile . 
+1 like brosnan's performance , evelyn comes from the heart . 
+1 sparse but oddly compelling . 
-1 murphy and wilson actually make a pretty good team . . . but the project surrounding them is distressingly rote . 
-1 anyone who wants to start writing screenplays can just follow the same blueprint from hundreds of other films , sell it to the highest bidder and walk away without anyone truly knowing your identity . 
-1 adrift , bentley and hudson stare and sniffle , respectively , as ledger attempts , in vain , to prove that movie-star intensity can overcome bad hair design . 
+1 one of the funnier movies in town . 
+1 a byzantine melodrama that stimulates the higher brain functions as well as the libido . 
-1 exists then as an occasionally insightful acting exercise . 
-1 a really funny fifteen-minute short stretched beyond its limits to fill an almost feature-length film . 
-1 there is a difference between movies with the courage to go over the top and movies that don't care about being stupid
-1 watching " ending " is too often like looking over the outdated clothes and plastic knickknacks at your neighbor's garage sale . you can't believe anyone would really buy this stuff . 
+1 standing in the shadows of motown is the best kind of documentary , one that makes a depleted yesterday feel very much like a brand-new tomorrow . 
-1 dull , if not devoid of wit , this shaggy dog longs to frisk through the back alleys of history , but scarcely manages more than a modest , snoozy charm . 
+1 el título no engaña : la película narra una historia donde una mujer enfrentará cierta realidad , y donde el sexo es . . . 
-1 a film that should be relegated to a dark video store corner is somehow making its way instead to theaters . it's hard to imagine acting that could be any flatter . 
+1 makes s&m seem very romantic , and maggie gyllenhaal is a delight . 
-1 unfortunately , it's also not very good . especially compared with the television series that inspired the movie . 
+1 like these russo guys lookin' for their mamet instead found their sturges . 
-1 mildly entertaining . 
+1  . . . one of the most ingenious and entertaining thrillers i've seen in quite a long time . 
+1 it's a technically superb film , shining with all the usual spielberg flair , expertly utilizing the talents of his top-notch creative team . 
-1  . . . a weak and ineffective ghost story without a conclusion or pay off . 
+1 the path ice age follows most closely , though , is the one established by warner bros . giant chuck jones , who died a matter of weeks before the movie's release . 
-1 it appears that something has been lost in the translation to the screen . 
+1 maud and roland's search for an unknowable past makes for a haunting literary detective story , but labute pulls off a neater trick in possession : he makes language sexy . 
+1 you watch for that sense of openness , the little surprises . 
-1 the makers of divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood should offer a free ticket ( second prize , of course , two free tickets ) to anyone who can locate a genuinely honest moment in their movie . 
+1 the riveting performances by the incredibly flexible cast make love a joy to behold . 
-1 in both the writing and cutting , it does not achieve the kind of dramatic unity that transports you . you end up simply admiring this bit or that , this performance or that . 
-1 another week , another gross-out college comedy--ugh . 
+1 the importance of being earnest , so thick with wit it plays like a reading from bartlett's familiar quotations
+1 a lot more dimensional and complex than its sunny disposition would lead you to believe . 
+1 george clooney , in his first directorial effort , presents this utterly ridiculous shaggy dog story as one of the most creative , energetic and original comedies to hit the screen in years . 
+1 at times a bit melodramatic and even a little dated ( depending upon where you live ) , ignorant fairies is still quite good-natured and not a bad way to spend an hour or two . 
-1 for dance completists only . 
+1 this real-life hollywood fairy-tale is more engaging than the usual fantasies hollywood produces . 
-1 the result is so tame that even slightly wised-up kids would quickly change the channel . 
+1 uno de los policiales más interesantes de los últimos tiempos . 
-1 although there are several truly jolting scares , there's also an abundance of hackneyed dialogue and more silly satanic business than you can shake a severed limb at . 
-1  sandra bullock and hugh grant make a great team , but this predictable romantic comedy should get a pink slip . 
+1 all in all , an interesting look at the life of the campaign-trail press , especially ones that don't really care for the candidate they're forced to follow . 
-1 more of a career curio than a major work . 
-1 the holiday message of the 37-minute santa vs . the snowman leaves a lot to be desired . 
+1 painful to watch , but viewers willing to take a chance will be rewarded with two of the year's most accomplished and riveting film performances . 
+1 a moving and stark reminder that the casualties of war reach much further than we imagine . 
+1 huppert's show to steal and she makes a meal of it , channeling kathy baker's creepy turn as the repressed mother on boston public just as much as 8 women's augustine . 
-1 the only young people who possibly will enjoy it are infants . . . who might be distracted by the movie's quick movements and sounds . 
-1 earnest but heavy-handed . 
-1 has the marks of a septuagenarian ; it's a crusty treatment of a clever gimmick . 
-1 a shambles of a movie--visually unattractive , unbearably loud and utterly silly . . . its hilarity is completely unintentional . 
+1 it rapidly develops into a gut-wrenching examination of the way cultural differences and emotional expectations collide . 
+1 fulford-wierzbicki . . . deftly captures the wise-beyond-her-years teen . 
-1 a movie that's held captive by mediocrity . not bad , but not all that good . bacon keeps things interesting , but don't go out of your way to pay full price . 
+1 if nothing else , this movie introduces a promising , unusual kind of psychological horror . 
+1 tense , terrific , sweaty-palmed fun . 
-1 i know we're not supposed to take it seriously , but i can't shake the thought that undercover brother missed an opportunity to strongly present some profound social commentary . 
+1 the film is a contrivance , as artificial as the video games japanese teens play in a nightclub sequence , but it's an enjoyable one . 
-1 when 'science fiction' takes advantage of the fact that its intended audience hasn't yet had much science , it does a disservice to the audience and to the genre . 
+1 this is one of those rare docs that paints a grand picture of an era and makes the journey feel like a party . 
+1 maneuvers skillfully through the plot's hot brine -- until it's undone by the sogginess of its contemporary characters , and actors . 
+1 dense , exhilarating documentary . 
-1 sadly , though many of the actors throw off a spark or two when they first appear , they can't generate enough heat in this cold vacuum of a comedy to start a reaction . 
+1 this version's no classic like its predecessor , but its pleasures are still plentiful . 
-1 a humorless journey into a philosophical void . 
+1 represents a worthy departure from the culture clash comedies that have marked an emerging indian american cinema . 
+1 although tender and touching , the movie would have benefited from a little more dramatic tension and some more editing . 
+1 by turns fanciful , grisly and engagingly quixotic . 
-1 i was perplexed to watch it unfold with an astonishing lack of passion or uniqueness . 
-1 it's depressing to see how far herzog has fallen . 
-1 several of steven soderbergh's earlier films were hailed as the works of an artist . sadly , full frontal plays like the work of a dilettante . 
+1 both a beautifully made nature film and a tribute to a woman whose passion for this region and its inhabitants still shines in her quiet blue eyes . 
+1 a sharp satire of desperation and cinematic deception . 
-1 haneke's script ( from elfriede jelinek's novel ) is contrived , unmotivated , and psychologically unpersuasive , with an inconclusive ending . 
+1 that the film opens with maggots crawling on a dead dog is not an out of place metaphor . 
-1 suffocated by its fussy script and uptight characters , this musty adaptation is all the more annoying since it's been packaged and sold back to us by hollywood . 
-1 interesting and thoroughly unfaithful version of carmen
-1 one senses in world traveler and in his earlier film that freundlich bears a grievous but obscure complaint against fathers , and circles it obsessively , without making contact . 
+1 rain is a small treasure , enveloping the viewer in a literal and spiritual torpor that is anything but cathartic . 
+1 one of those unassuming films that sneaks up on you and stays with you long after you have left the theatre . 
+1 this is not chabrol's best , but even his lesser works outshine the best some directors can offer . 
+1  . . . the implication is kissinger may have decided that  when it comes to truncheoning  it's better to give than to receive . 
+1 director-writer bille august . . . depicts this relationship with economical grace , letting his superb actors convey martin's deterioration and barbara's sadness -- and , occasionally , anger . 
+1 [cho's face is] an amazing slapstick instrument , creating a scrapbook of living mug shots . 
+1 a celebration of quirkiness , eccentricity , and certain individuals' tendency to let it all hang out , and damn the consequences . 
+1 its adult themes of familial separation and societal betrayal are head and shoulders above much of the director's previous popcorn work . 
+1 a very funny romantic comedy about two skittish new york middle-agers who stumble into a relationship and then struggle furiously with their fears and foibles . 
+1 ali's graduation from little screen to big is far less painful than his opening scene encounter with an over-amorous terrier . 
-1 as aimless as an old pickup skidding completely out of control on a long patch of black ice , the movie makes two hours feel like four . 
+1 suffice to say that after seeing this movie in imax form , you'll be more acquainted with the tiniest details of tom hanks' face than his wife is . 
-1 despite its raucous intent , xxx is as conventional as a nike ad and as rebellious as spring break . 
+1  . . . a fairly disposable yet still entertaining b picture . 
+1 daughter from danang sticks with its subjects a little longer and tells a deeper story
-1  " juwanna mann ? " no thanks . wewannour money back , actually . 
-1 the movie slides downhill as soon as macho action conventions assert themselves . 
+1 an often watchable , though goofy and lurid , blast of a costume drama set in the late 15th century . 
-1 a simple , sometimes maddeningly slow film that has just enough charm and good acting to make it interesting , but is ultimately pulled under by the pacing and lack of creativity within . 
+1 the unique niche of self-critical , behind-the-scenes navel-gazing kaufman has carved from orleans' story and his own infinite insecurity is a work of outstanding originality . 
+1 an interesting psychological game of cat-and-mouse , three-dimensional characters and believable performances all add up to a satisfying crime drama . 
-1 the actors improvise and scream their way around this movie directionless , lacking any of the rollicking dark humor so necessary to make this kind of idea work on screen . 
+1 mostly works because of the universal themes , earnest performances . . . and excellent use of music by india's popular gulzar and jagjit singh . 
+1 the film is saved from aren't-kids-cute sentimentality by a warmth that isn't faked and a stately sense of composition . 
-1 the script is a tired one , with few moments of joy rising above the stale material . 
-1 hopelessly inane , humorless and under-inspired . 
+1 reign of fire is hardly the most original fantasy film ever made -- beyond road warrior , it owes enormous debts to aliens and every previous dragon drama -- but that barely makes it any less entertaining . 
-1 i suspect that there are more interesting ways of dealing with the subject . 
-1 it's a fanboy 'what if ? ' brought to life on the big screen . 
+1 i know that i'll never listen to marvin gaye or the supremes the same way again
+1 worth a salute just for trying to be more complex than your average film . 
-1 contains all the substance of a twinkie -- easy to swallow , but scarcely nourishing . 
-1 it's a stale , overused cocktail using the same olives since 1962 as garnish . not only is entry number twenty the worst of the brosnan bunch , it's one of the worst of the entire franchise . 
+1 though the film's scenario is certainly not earthshaking , this depiction of fluctuating female sexuality has two winning lead performances and charm to spare . 
+1 those with a modicum of patience will find in these characters' foibles a timeless and unique perspective . 
-1 try as i may , i can't think of a single good reason to see this movie , even though everyone in my group extemporaneously shouted , 'thank you ! ' when leguizamo finally plugged an irritating character late in the movie . 
-1 sewer rats could watch this movie and be so skeeved out that they'd need a shower . 
+1 a well-made and often lovely depiction of the mysteries of friendship . 
-1 is it a comedy ? a drama ? a romance ? a cartoon ? 
+1 real women have curves doesn't offer any easy answers . 
+1 k-19 will not go down in the annals of cinema as one of the great submarine stories , but it is an engaging and exciting narrative of man confronting the demons of his own fear and paranoia . 
+1  " 13 conversations about one thing " is an intelligent flick that examines many different ideas from happiness to guilt in an intriguing bit of storytelling . 
+1 hip-hop has a history , and it's a metaphor for this love story . 
+1 this seductive tease of a thriller gets the job done . it's a scorcher . 
-1 i was hoping that it would be sleazy and fun , but it was neither . 
+1 hawn and sarandon form an acting bond that makes the banger sisters a fascinating character study with laughs to spare . 
+1 franco is an excellent choice for the walled-off but combustible hustler , but he does not give the transcendent performance sonny needs to overcome gaps in character development and story logic . 
+1 it's about individual moments of mood , and an aimlessness that's actually sort of amazing . 
+1 offers big , fat , dumb laughs that may make you hate yourself for giving in . ah , what the hell . 
-1  . . . the picture's cleverness is ironically muted by the very people who are intended to make it shine . 
+1 executed with such gentle but insistent sincerity , with such good humor and appreciation of the daily grind that only the most hardhearted scrooge could fail to respond . 
-1 eight legged freaks ? no big hairy deal . 
-1 the french director has turned out nearly 21/2 hours of unfocused , excruciatingly tedious cinema that , half an hour in , starts making water torture seem appealing . 
-1 a huge disappointment coming , as it does , from filmmakers and performers of this calibre
-1 the action switches between past and present , but the material link is too tenuous to anchor the emotional connections that purport to span a 125-year divide . 
+1 it's not exactly a gourmet meal but the fare is fair , even coming from the drive-thru . 
+1 in a movie full of surprises , the biggest is that secret ballot is a comedy , both gentle and biting . 
-1 manages to show life in all of its banality when the intention is quite the opposite . 
+1 it all adds up to good fun . 
-1 while the importance of being earnest offers opportunities for occasional smiles and chuckles , it doesn't give us a reason to be in the theater beyond wilde's wit and the actors' performances . 
+1 lan yu seems altogether too slight to be called any kind of masterpiece . it is , however , a completely honest , open-hearted film that should appeal to anyone willing to succumb to it . 
-1 `hey arnold ! ' has some visual wit . . . but little imagination elsewhere . 
-1 a compendium of solondz's own worst instincts in under 90 minutes . 
+1 by turns gripping , amusing , tender and heart-wrenching , laissez-passer has all the earmarks of french cinema at its best . 
-1 neither as scary-funny as tremors nor demented-funny as starship troopers , the movie isn't tough to take as long as you've paid a matinee price . 
+1 pratfalls aside , barbershop gets its greatest play from the timeless spectacle of people really talking to each other . 
-1 no way i can believe this load of junk . 
+1 in death to smoochy , we don't get williams' usual tear and a smile , just sneers and bile , and the spectacle is nothing short of refreshing . 
+1 jae-eun jeong's take care of my cat brings a beguiling freshness to a coming-of-age story with such a buoyant , expressive flow of images that it emerges as another key contribution to the flowering of the south korean cinema . 
-1 like its parade of predecessors , this halloween is a gory slash-fest . it can't escape its past , and it doesn't want to . 
-1 the screenplay by james eric , james horton and director peter o'fallon . . . is so pat it makes your teeth hurt . 
-1  . . . an incredibly heavy-handed , manipulative dud that feels all too familiar . 
+1 while scorsese's bold images and generally smart casting ensure that " gangs " is never lethargic , the movie is hindered by a central plot that's peppered with false starts and populated by characters who are nearly impossible to care about . 
+1 even with all its botches , enigma offers all the pleasure of a handsome and well-made entertainment . 
-1 i've never seen ( a remake ) do anything as stomach-turning as the way adam sandler's new movie rapes , pillages and incinerates frank capra's classic . . . 
-1 there's more scatological action in 8 crazy nights than a proctologist is apt to encounter in an entire career . 
+1 a forceful drama of an alienated executive who re-invents himself . 
+1 leigh's daring here is that without once denying the hardscrabble lives of people on the economic fringes of margaret thatcher's ruinous legacy , he insists on the importance of those moments when people can connect and express their love for each other . 
-1 a low-budget affair , tadpole was shot on digital video , and the images often look smeary and blurry , to the point of distraction . then again , in a better movie , you might not have noticed . 
-1 there's an audience for it , but it could have been funnier and more innocent . 
+1 if you haven't seen the film lately , you may be surprised at the variety of tones in spielberg's work . much of it is funny , but there are also some startling , surrealistic moments . . . 
+1 catch it . . . if you can ! 
+1 i enjoyed time of favor while i was watching it , but i was surprised at how quickly it faded from my memory . 
-1 when a film is created solely because it's a marketable product , soulless and ugly movies like this are the result . let your silly childhood nostalgia slumber unmolested . 
-1 meandering and confusing . 
+1 cineasts will revel in those visual in-jokes , as in the film's verbal pokes at everything from the likes of miramax chief harvey weinstein's bluff personal style to the stylistic rigors of denmark's dogma movement . 
-1 admirable , certainly , but not much fun to watch . for caine lovers only . 
+1 it treats ana's journey with honesty that is tragically rare in the depiction of young women in film . 
+1 a good music documentary , probably one of the best since the last waltz . 
-1 the master of disguise is funny--not " ha ha " funny , " dead circus performer " funny . and for all the wrong reasons besides . 
+1 if this story must be told and retold -- and indeed it must -- then the grey zone is to be lauded for finding a new and ingenious angle . 
-1 in between the icy stunts , the actors spout hilarious dialogue about following your dream and 'just letting the mountain tell you what to do . '
+1 all the actors are good in pauline & paulette but van der groen , described as 'belgium's national treasure , ' is especially terrific as pauline . 
+1 a poignant and gently humorous parable that loves its characters and communicates something rather beautiful about human nature . 
+1 significantly better than its 2002 children's-movie competition . 
-1 rodriguez . . . was unable to reproduce the special spark between the characters that made the first film such a delight . 
+1 it moves quickly , adroitly , and without fuss ; it doesn't give you time to reflect on the inanity -- and the cold war datedness -- of its premise . 
-1 as saccharine movies go , this is likely to cause massive cardiac arrest if taken in large doses . 
-1 velocity represents everything wrong with ''independent film'' as a commodified , sold-out concept on the american filmmaking scene . 
-1 a full-frontal attack on audience patience . 
+1 a tasty appetizer that leaves you wanting more . 
+1 though lan yu lacks a sense of dramatic urgency , the film makes up for it with a pleasing verisimilitude . 
+1 an awfully good , achingly human picture . 
+1 as relationships shift , director robert j . siegel allows the characters to inhabit their world without cleaving to a narrative arc . 
-1 it shows that some studios firmly believe that people have lost the ability to think and will forgive any shoddy product as long as there's a little girl-on-girl action . 
-1 these people wouldn't know subtle characterization if it put on a giant furry monster costume and then gave them a lapdance . 
+1  . . . a guiltless film for nice evening out . 
+1 the film may not hit as hard as some of the better drug-related pictures , but it still manages to get a few punches in . 
-1 it's loud and boring ; watching it is like being trapped at a bad rock concert . 
+1 the ensemble cast turns in a collectively stellar performance , and the writing is tight and truthful , full of funny situations and honest observations . 
+1 time out is as serious as a pink slip . and more than that , it's an observant , unfussily poetic meditation about identity and alienation . 
-1 costner's warm-milk persona is just as ill-fitting as shadyac's perfunctory directing chops , and some of the more overtly silly dialogue would sink laurence olivier . 
+1 a spellbinding african film about the modern condition of rootlessness , a state experienced by millions around the globe . 
-1 bad company has one of the most moronic screenplays of the year , full of holes that will be obvious even to those who aren't looking for them . 
+1 as action-adventure , this space-based homage to robert louis stevenson's treasure island fires on all plasma conduits . 
+1 thurman and lewis are hilarious throughout . 
+1 brown sugar signals director rick famuyiwa's emergence as an articulate , grown-up voice in african-american cinema . 
-1 godard's ode to tackling life's wonderment is a rambling and incoherent manifesto about the vagueness of topical excess . . . in praise of love remains a ponderous and pretentious endeavor that's unfocused and tediously exasperating . 
+1 an ingenious and often harrowing look at damaged people and how families can offer either despair or consolation . 
+1 we admire this film for its harsh objectivity and refusal to seek our tears , our sympathies . 
-1 low rent from frame one . 
+1 if you can read the subtitles ( the opera is sung in italian ) and you like 'masterpiece theatre' type costumes , you'll enjoy this movie . 
+1 [dong] makes a valiant effort to understand everyone's point of view , and he does such a good job of it that family fundamentals gets you riled up . 
+1 happily , some things are immune to the folly of changing taste and attitude . for proof of that on the cinematic front , look no further than this 20th anniversary edition of the film that spielberg calls , retrospectively , his most personal work yet . 
+1 lauren ambrose comes alive under the attention from two strangers in town - with honest performances and realistic interaction between the characters , this is a coming-of-age story with a twist . 
-1 never again swings between false sentiment and unfunny madcap comedy and , along the way , expects the audience to invest in the central relationship as some kind of marriage of true minds . 
+1 colorful and deceptively buoyant until it suddenly pulls the rug out from under you , burkinabe filmmaker dani kouyate's reworking of a folk story whose roots go back to 7th-century oral traditions is also a pointed political allegory . 
+1 the sort of film that makes me miss hitchcock , but also feel optimistic that there's hope for popular cinema yet . 
+1 what makes how i killed my father compelling , besides its terrific performances , is fontaine's willingness to wander into the dark areas of parent-child relationships without flinching . 
-1 the movie is so resolutely cobbled together out of older movies that it even uses a totally unnecessary prologue , just because it seems obligatory . 
+1 even if you don't think [kissinger's] any more guilty of criminal activity than most contemporary statesmen , he'd sure make a courtroom trial great fun to watch . 
+1 i prefer soderbergh's concentration on his two lovers over tarkovsky's mostly male , mostly patriarchal debating societies . 
-1 it's not exactly worth the bucks to expend the full price for a date , but when it comes out on video , it's well worth a rental . 
+1 rehearsals are frequently more fascinating than the results . last dance , whatever its flaws , fulfills one facet of its mission in making me want to find out whether , in this case , that's true . 
+1 this english-language version . . . does full honor to miyazaki's teeming and often unsettling landscape , and to the conflicted complexity of his characters . 
+1 a fun ride . 
-1 warmed-over tarantino by way of wannabe elmore leonard . 
-1 the movie is obviously a labour of love so howard appears to have had free rein to be as pretentious as he wanted . 
-1 in old-fashioned screenwriting parlance , ms . shreve's novel proved too difficult a text to 'lick , ' despite the efforts of a first-rate cast . 
-1 should have been worth cheering as a breakthrough but is devoid of wit and humor . 
-1 i found the movie as divided against itself as the dysfunctional family it portrays . 
+1 at its best ( and it does have some very funny sequences ) looking for leonard reminds you just how comically subversive silence can be . 
+1 leigh makes these lives count . and he allows a gawky actor like spall -- who could too easily become comic relief in any other film -- to reveal his impressively delicate range . 
+1 at once disarmingly straightforward and strikingly devious . 
+1 a compelling journey . . . and " his best friend remembers " is up there with the finest of specials . 
+1 katz uses archival footage , horrifying documents of lynchings , still photographs and charming old reel-to-reel recordings of meeropol entertaining his children to create his song history , but most powerful of all is the song itself
-1 deliberately and devotedly constructed , far from heaven is too picture postcard perfect , too neat and new pin-like , too obviously a recreation to resonate . 
-1 ararat feels like a book report
+1 feature debuter d . j . caruso directs a crack ensemble cast , bringing screenwriter tony gayton's narcotics noir to life . 
+1 the story , like life , refuses to be simple , and the result is a compelling slice of awkward emotions . 
+1 wonderful fencing scenes and an exciting plot make this an eminently engrossing film . 
-1 it's supposed to be a romantic comedy - it suffers from too much norma rae and not enough pretty woman . 
-1 in the second half of the film , frei's control loosens in direct proportion to the amount of screen time he gives nachtwey for self-analysis . 
-1 mckay shows crushingly little curiosity about , or is ill-equipped to examine , the interior lives of the characters in his film , much less incorporate them into his narrative . 
-1 the movie is too impressed with its own solemn insights to work up much entertainment value . 
-1 a chilly , remote , emotionally distant piece . . . so dull that its tagline should be : 'in space , no one can hear you snore . '
+1 energetic and boldly provocative . 
+1 '[the cockettes] provides a window into a subculture hell-bent on expressing itself in every way imaginable . '
+1  . . . while each moment of this broken character study is rich in emotional texture , the journey doesn't really go anywhere . 
-1 it's hard to believe that a relationship like holly and marina's could survive the hothouse emotions of teendom , and its longevity gets more inexplicable as the characterizations turn more crassly reductive . 
-1 some elements of it really blow the big one , but other parts are decent . 
+1 writer-director david jacobson and his star , jeremy renner , have made a remarkable film that explores the monster's psychology not in order to excuse him but rather to demonstrate that his pathology evolved from human impulses that grew hideously twisted . 
+1 a riveting profile of law enforcement , and a visceral , nasty journey into an urban hades . 
+1 one of the pleasures in walter's documentary . . . is the parade of veteran painters , confounded dealers , and miscellaneous bohos who expound upon the subject's mysterious personality without ever explaining him . 
+1 if you can get past the fantastical aspects and harsh realities of " the isle " you'll get a sock-you-in-the-eye flick that is a visual tour-de-force and a story that is unlike any you will likely see anywhere else . 
+1 just the labour involved in creating the layered richness of the imagery in this chiaroscuro of madness and light is astonishing . 
+1 those who love cinema paradiso will find the new scenes interesting , but few will find the movie improved . 
-1 mr . deeds is not really a film as much as it is a loose collection of not-so-funny gags , scattered moments of lazy humor . 
+1 a . . . cynical and serious look at teenage boys doing what they do best - being teenagers . 
-1 new best friend's playboy-mansion presentation of college life is laugh-out-loud ludicrous . 
-1 what little grace [rifkin's] tale of precarious skid-row dignity achieves is pushed into the margins by predictable plotting and tiresome histrionics . 
+1 thanks to a small star with big heart , this family film sequel is plenty of fun for all . 
-1 anthony hopkins ? big deal ! we've already seen the prequel to the silence of the lambs and hannibal -- and it was better the first time . 
-1 how inept is serving sara ? it makes even elizabeth hurley seem graceless and ugly . 
-1 the most memorable moment was when green threw medical equipment at a window ; not because it was particularly funny , but because i had a serious urge to grab the old lady at the end of my aisle's walker and toss it at the screen in frustration . 
+1 a fascinating , dark thriller that keeps you hooked on the delicious pulpiness of its lurid fiction . 
+1 more concerned with sade's ideas than with his actions . the movie achieves as great an impact by keeping these thoughts hidden as . . . [quills] did by showing them . 
-1 cold , pretentious , thoroughly dislikable study in sociopathy . 
+1 cantet beautifully illuminates what it means sometimes to be inside looking out , and at other times outside looking in . 
+1 it was only a matter of time before some savvy producer saw the potential success inherent in the mixture of bullock bubble and hugh goo . 
+1 directing with a sure and measured hand , [haneke] steers clear of the sensational and offers instead an unflinching and objective look at a decidedly perverse pathology . 
-1 some body is a shaky , uncertain film that nevertheless touches a few raw nerves . 
+1 pete's screenplay manages to find that real natural , even-flowing tone that few movies are able to accomplish . 
-1 everyone connected to this movie seems to be part of an insider clique , which tends to breed formulaic films rather than fresh ones . 
-1 a moving picture that does not move . 
-1 most of the information has already appeared in one forum or another and , no matter how broomfield dresses it up , it tends to speculation , conspiracy theories or , at best , circumstantial evidence . 
-1 here the love scenes all end in someone screaming . maybe there's a metaphor here , but figuring it out wouldn't make trouble every day any better . 
-1 we may never think of band camp as a geeky or nerdy thing again . 
+1 the two leads chomp considerably more scenery with their acting than fire-breathing monsters barbecue with their breath . . . 
+1 an enjoyable feel-good family comedy regardless of race . 
+1 a bowel-curdling , heart-stopping recipe for terror . 
-1 a fitfully amusing romp that , if nothing else , will appeal to fans of malcolm in the middle and its pubescent star , frankie muniz . 
+1 waydowntown manages to nail the spirit-crushing ennui of denuded urban living without giving in to it . 
+1 uses sharp humor and insight into human nature to examine class conflict , adolescent yearning , the roots of friendship and sexual identity . 
+1 another in a long line of ultra-violent war movies , this one is not quite what it could have been as a film , but the story and theme make up for it . 
-1 a pretentious mess . 
+1 a movie of riveting power and sadness . 
+1 the immersive powers of the giant screen and its hyper-realistic images are put to perfect use in the breathtakingly beautiful outer-space documentary space station 3d . 
-1 a movie that seems motivated more by a desire to match mortarboards with dead poets society and good will hunting than by its own story . 
-1 made by jackasses for jackasses . 
-1 the end result is like cold porridge with only the odd enjoyably chewy lump . 
+1 vera's three actors -- mollà , gil and bardem -- excel in insightful , empathetic performances . 
+1 a movie that's just plain awful but still manages to entertain on a guilty-pleasure , so-bad-it's-funny level . 
+1 [a] rare movie that makes us re-assess the basis for our lives and evaluate what is truly ours in a world of meaningless activity . 
+1 simple , poignant and leavened with humor , it's a film that affirms the nourishing aspects of love and companionship . 
+1 if divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood suffers from a ploddingly melodramatic structure , it comes to life in the performances . 
+1 the kind of trifle that date nights were invented for . 
-1 like schindler's list , the grey zone attempts to be grandiloquent , but ends up merely pretentious -- in a grisly sort of way . 
+1 read my lips is to be viewed and treasured for its extraordinary intelligence and originality as well as its lyrical variations on the game of love . 
+1 just how these families interact may surprise you . 
+1 a remarkably alluring film set in the constrictive eisenhower era about one suburban woman's yearning in the face of a loss that shatters her cheery and tranquil suburban life . 
-1 ah-nuld's action hero days might be over . 
+1 a fascinating and fun film . 
-1 [a] slummer . 
-1 barely gets off the ground . 
+1 lookin' for sin , american-style ? try hell house , which documents the cautionary christian spook-a-rama of the same name . 
+1 this beautifully animated epic is never dull . 
+1 it's a perfect show of respect to just one of those underrated professionals who deserve but rarely receive it . 
+1 consummate actor barry has done excellent work here . 
+1 like a veteran head cutter , barbershop is tuned in to its community . 
-1 meticulously mounted , exasperatingly well-behaved film , which ticks off kahlo's lifetime milestones with the dutiful precision of a tax accountant . 
-1 i can't quite recommend it -- it's too patched together -- but i almost can ; it's the kind of movie that makes you want to like it . 
-1 the verdict : two bodies and hardly a laugh between them . 
+1 an unforgettable look at morality , family , and social expectation through the prism of that omnibus tradition called marriage . 
-1  at its best , it's black hawk down with more heart . at its worst , it's rambo- meets-john ford . 
-1 a yawn-provoking little farm melodrama . 
-1 starts off witty and sophisticated and you want to love it -- but filmmaker yvan attal quickly writes himself into a corner . 
-1 britney's performance cannot be faulted . lucy's a dull girl , that's all . 
-1 it's a hellish , numbing experience to watch , and it doesn't offer any insights that haven't been thoroughly debated in the media already , back in the dahmer heyday of the mid-'90s . 
+1 the film is all a little lit crit 101 , but it's extremely well played and often very funny . 
-1 a dreadful live-action movie . 
-1 it's got its heart in the right place , but it also wilts after awhile . 
+1  . . . with " the bourne identity " we return to the more traditional action genre . 
-1 all's well that ends well , and rest assured , the consciousness-raising lessons are cloaked in gross-out gags . 
-1 'the war of the roses , ' trailer-trash style . entertaining but like shooting fish in a barrel . 
-1 far too clever by half , howard's film is really a series of strung-together moments , with all the spaces in between filled with fantasies , daydreams , memories and one fantastic visual trope after another . 
-1 bad company . bad movie . just plain bad . 
+1 highlighted by a gritty style and an excellent cast , it's better than one might expect when you look at the list of movies starring ice-t in a major role . 
+1 this charming , thought-provoking new york fest of life and love has its rewards . 
+1 full of profound , real-life moments that anyone can relate to , it deserves a wide audience . 
-1 it's frustrating to see these guys -- who are obviously pretty clever -- waste their talent on parodies of things they probably thought were funniest when they were high . 
+1 would be an unendurable viewing experience for this ultra-provincial new yorker if 26-year-old reese witherspoon were not on hand to inject her pure fantasy character , melanie carmichael , with a massive infusion of old-fashioned hollywood magic . 
+1 if you're like me , a sucker for a good old fashion romance and someone who shamelessly loves to eat , then mostly martha offers all the perfect ingredients to more than satisfy your appetite . 
-1 feels like six different movies fighting each other for attention . 
-1 a recipe for cinematic disaster . . . part quentin tarantino , part guy ritchie , and part 1960s spy spoof , it's all bad . 
+1  . . . somehow manages to escape the shackles of its own clichés to be the best espionage picture to come out in weeks . 
-1 more likely to have you scratching your head than hiding under your seat . 
+1 it's rare for any movie to be as subtle and touching as the son's room . 
+1 the journey to the secret's eventual discovery is a separate adventure , and thrill enough . 
+1  . . . it's as comprehensible as any dummies guide , something even non-techies can enjoy . 
+1 a behind the scenes look at the training and dedication that goes into becoming a world-class fencer and the champion that's made a difference to nyc inner-city youth . 
+1 a splendid entertainment , young in spirit but accomplished in all aspects with the fullness of spirit and sense of ease that comes only with experience . 
+1 this bracingly truthful antidote to hollywood teenage movies that slather clearasil over the blemishes of youth captures the combustible mixture of a chafing inner loneliness and desperate grandiosity that tend to characterize puberty . 
+1 the movie's relatively simple plot and uncomplicated morality play well with the affable cast . 
+1 makes even the claustrophobic on-board quarters seem fun . 
-1 the movie is genial but never inspired , and little about it will stay with you . 
+1 it's a masterpiece . 
-1 this time mr . burns is trying something in the martin scorsese street-realist mode , but his self-regarding sentimentality trips him up again . 
-1 soulless and -- even more damning -- virtually joyless , xxx achieves near virtuosity in its crapulence . 
+1 the first bond movie in ages that isn't fake fun . 
-1 its and pieces of the hot chick are so hilarious , and schneider's performance is so fine , it's a real shame that so much of the movie -- again , as in the animal -- is a slapdash mess . 
+1 my big fat greek wedding uses stereotypes in a delightful blend of sweet romance and lovingly dished out humor . 
-1 all in all , there's only one thing to root for : expulsion for everyone . 
+1 i have always appreciated a smartly written motion picture , and , whatever flaws igby goes down may possess , it is undeniably that . 
-1 this is an egotistical endeavor from the daughter of horror director dario argento ( a producer here ) , but her raw performance and utter fearlessness make it strangely magnetic .

+1 performances all around are tops , with the two leads delivering oscar-caliber performances . 
+1 though it's equally solipsistic in tone , the movie has enough vitality to justify the notion of creating a screen adaptation of evans' saga of hollywood excess .

-1 the dark and bittersweet twist feels strange as things turn nasty and tragic during the final third of the film . first-timer john mckay is never able to pull it back on course . 
-1 by the end , you just don't care whether that cold-hearted snake petrovich ( that would be reno ) gets his comeuppance . just bring on the battle bots , please ! 
+1 i'll put it this way : if you're in the mood for a melodrama narrated by talking fish , this is the movie for you . 
+1 blanchett's performance confirms her power once again . 
-1 usually when i get this much syrup , i like pancakes to go with it . 
-1 whenever its story isn't bogged down by idiocy involving the cia and a lost u . s . satellite , hunter -- starring irwin and his american wife/colleague , terri -- is a movie children should enjoy . 
-1 this is for the most part a useless movie , even with a great director at the helm . 
-1 the film meant well in its horse tale about freedom , but wasn't able to reach the heart because it was too overbearing . 
-1 a movie that tries to fuse the two 'woods' but winds up a bolly-holly masala mess . 
+1 unexpected , and often contradictory , truths emerge . 
+1 ramsay is clearly extraordinarily talented , and based on three short films and two features , here's betting her third feature will be something to behold . 
+1 you may feel compelled to watch the film twice or pick up a book on the subject . 
-1 expect to be reminded of other , better films , especially seven , which director william malone slavishly copies . 
-1 the film never finds its tone and several scenes run too long . 
+1 its almost too-spectacular coastal setting distracts slightly from an eccentric and good-naturedly aimless story . 
+1 like the rugrats movies , the wild thornberrys movie doesn't offer much more than the series , but its emphasis on caring for animals and respecting other cultures is particularly welcome . 
-1 intriguing documentary which is emotionally diluted by focusing on the story's least interesting subject . 
+1 uses high comedy to evoke surprising poignance . 
-1 an earnest , heartrending look at the divide between religious fundamentalists and their gay relatives . it's also heavy-handed and devotes too much time to bigoted views . 
+1 begins like a docu-drama but builds its multi-character story with a flourish . 
+1 all right , so it's not a brilliant piece of filmmaking , but it is a funny ( sometimes hilarious ) comedy with a deft sense of humor about itself , a playful spirit and a game cast . 
-1 simply put , there should have been a more compelling excuse to pair susan sarandon and goldie hawn . 
-1 it's a grab bag of genres that don't add up to a whole lot of sense . 
-1 at times , the movie looks genuinely pretty . your nightmares , on the other hand , will be anything but . not even felinni would know what to make of this italian freakshow . 
-1 like watching a dress rehearsal the week before the show goes up : everything's in place but something's just a little off-kilter . 
-1 while we want macdowell's character to retrieve her husband , we have to ask whether her personal odyssey trumps the carnage that claims so many lives around her . 
+1  . . . quite good at providing some good old fashioned spooks . 
-1 a somewhat disappointing and meandering saga . 
+1 nicole kidman evolved from star to superstar some time over the past year , which means that birthday girl is the kind of quirkily appealing minor movie she might not make for a while . 
+1 high on melodrama . but it's emotionally engrossing , too , thanks to strong , credible performances from the whole cast . 
-1 it's unfortunate that wallace , who wrote gibson's braveheart as well as the recent pearl harbor , has such an irrepressible passion for sappy situations and dialogue . 
-1 sitting through the last reel ( spoiler alert ! ) is significantly less charming than listening to a four-year-old with a taste for exaggeration recount his halloween trip to the haunted house . 
+1 there is nothing outstanding about this film , but it is good enough and will likely be appreciated most by sailors and folks who know their way around a submarine . 
+1 bogdanovich tantalizes by offering a peep show into the lives of the era's creme de la celluloid . 
+1  . . . a good , if not entirely fresh , look at war . 
+1 although estela bravo's documentary is cloyingly hagiographic in its portrait of cuban leader fidel castro , it's still a guilty pleasure to watch . 
+1 there are moments in this account of the life of artist frida kahlo that are among cinema's finest this year . unfortunately , they're sandwiched in between the most impossibly dry account of kahlo's life imaginable . 
+1  " . . . something appears to have been lost in the translation this time . the importance of being earnest movie seems to be missing a great deal of the acerbic repartee of the play . " 
-1 stiff and schmaltzy and clumsily directed . 
+1 [westbrook] makes a wonderful subject for the camera . 
+1 like vardalos and corbett , who play their roles with vibrant charm , the film , directed by joel zwick , is heartfelt and hilarious in ways you can't fake . 
+1 uplifting as only a document of the worst possibilities of mankind can be , and among the best films of the year . 
-1 movie fans , get ready to take off . . . the other direction . 
+1 for veggietales fans , this is more appetizing than a side dish of asparagus . if you're not a fan , it might be like trying to eat brussels sprouts . 
-1 the script was reportedly rewritten a dozen times -- either 11 times too many or else too few . 
+1 sweet home alabama " is what it is  a nice , harmless date film . . . 
-1 has the disjointed feel of a bunch of strung-together tv episodes . 
+1 there are so few films about the plight of american indians in modern america that skins comes as a welcome , if downbeat , missive from a forgotten front . 
-1 to be oblivious to the existence of this film would be very sweet indeed . 
-1 would benigni's italian pinocchio have been any easier to sit through than this hastily dubbed disaster ? 
-1 is it really an advantage to invest such subtlety and warmth in an animatronic bear when the humans are acting like puppets ? 
-1 mocking kung fu pictures when they were a staple of exploitation theater programming was witty . mocking them now is an exercise in pointlessness . 
+1 almost peerlessly unsettling . 
-1 the whole mess boils down to a transparently hypocritical work that feels as though it's trying to set the women's liberation movement back 20 years . 
-1 unwieldy contraption . 
-1 the picture is a primer on what happens when lack of know-how mixes with lack of give-a-damn . 
-1 the stripped-down approach does give the film a certain timeless quality , but the measured pace and lack of dramatic inflection can also seem tedious . 
+1 there's . . . tremendous energy from the cast , a sense of playfulness and excitement that seems appropriate . 
-1 worth seeing once , but its charm quickly fades . 
+1 the writing is clever and the cast is appealing . 
-1 nothing but an episode of smackdown ! in period costume and with a bigger budget . 
+1 nothing denis has made before , like beau travil and nenette et boni , could prepare us for this gory , perverted , sex-soaked riff on the cannibal genre . 
+1 inside the film's conflict-powered plot there is a decent moral trying to get out , but it's not that , it's the tension that keeps you in your seat . affleck and jackson are good sparring partners . 
+1 among the year's most intriguing explorations of alientation . 
-1 if you adored the full monty so resoundingly that you're dying to see the same old thing in a tired old setting , then this should keep you reasonably entertained . 
+1 a movie with a real anarchic flair . 
-1 es triste tener que decirles que lo único grato de la cinta es el cuerpo desnudo de la heather . . . 
-1 a workshop mentality prevails . 
+1 making such a tragedy the backdrop to a love story risks trivializing it , though chouraqui no doubt intended the film to affirm love's power to help people endure almost unimaginable horror . 
+1 if you're looking for a smart , nuanced look at de sade and what might have happened at picpus , sade is your film . 
-1 the venezuelans say things like " si , pretty much " and " por favor , go home " when talking to americans . that's muy loco , but no more ridiculous than most of the rest of " dragonfly . " 
-1 [tries] to parody a genre that's already a joke in the united states . the movie is the equivalent of french hip-hop , which also seems to play on a 10-year delay . 
+1 about a manga-like heroine who fights back at her abusers , it's energetic and satisfying if not deep and psychological . 
+1 late marriage is an in-your-face family drama and black comedy that is filled with raw emotions conveying despair and love . 
+1 does an impressive job of relating the complicated history of the war and of filling in the background . 
-1  " sorority boys " was funnier , and that movie was pretty bad . 
+1 though it is by no means his best work , laissez-passer is a distinguished and distinctive effort by a bona-fide master , a fascinating film replete with rewards to be had by all willing to make the effort to reap them . 
-1 silly , loud and goofy . 
-1 the film is all over the place , really . it dabbles all around , never gaining much momentum . 
-1 feel bad for king , who's honestly trying , and schwartzman , who's shot himself in the foot .

+1 highlights are the terrific performances by christopher plummer , as the prime villain , and nathan lane as vincent crummles , the eccentric theater company manager . 
-1 starts out mediocre , spirals downward , and thuds to the bottom of the pool with an utterly incompetent conclusion . 
+1 it is hard not to be especially grateful for freedom after a film like this . 
-1 formula 51 promises a new kind of high but delivers the same old bad trip . 
+1 in addition to gluing you to the edge of your seat , changing lanes is also a film of freshness , imagination and insight . 
+1 most of crush is a clever and captivating romantic comedy with a welcome pinch of tartness . 
+1 there is truth here
+1 the acting in pauline and paulette is good all round , but what really sets the film apart is debrauwer's refusal to push the easy emotional buttons . 
+1 a confident , richly acted , emotionally devastating piece of work and 2002's first great film
-1 john leguizamo may be a dramatic actor -- just not in this movie . 
-1 this is the first full scale wwii flick from hong kong's john woo . he's not good with people . 
-1 it's the funniest american comedy since graffiti bridge . 
+1 a well-crafted film that is all the more remarkable because it achieves its emotional power and moments of revelation with restraint and a delicate ambiguity . 
-1 rather less than the sum of its underventilated père-fils confrontations . 
-1 elaborate special effects take centre screen , so that the human story is pushed to one side . 
-1 suffers from a decided lack of creative storytelling . 
+1 it's full of cheesy dialogue , but great trashy fun that finally returns de palma to his pulpy thrillers of the early '80s . 
+1 kudos to the most enchanting film of the year . 
+1 what sets this romantic comedy apart from most hollywood romantic comedies is its low-key way of tackling what seems like done-to-death material . 
+1 i was impressed by how many tit-for-tat retaliatory responses the filmmakers allow before pulling the plug on the conspirators and averting an american-russian armageddon . 
-1 [a] painfully flat gross-out comedy . . . 
-1 a weird little movie that's amusing enough while you watch it , offering fine acting moments and pungent insights into modern l . a . 's show-biz and media subcultures . but it doesn't leave you with much . 
-1 strangely comes off as a kingdom more mild than wild . 
-1 the screenplay flounders under the weight of too many story lines . 
+1 u . s . audiences may find [attal and gainsbourg's] unfamiliar personas give the film an intimate and quaint reality that is a little closer to human nature than what hollywood typically concocts . 
-1 comes off more like a misdemeanor , a flat , unconvincing drama that never catches fire . 
+1 the real charm of this trifle is the deadpan comic face of its star , jean reno , who resembles sly stallone in a hot sake half-sleep . 
-1 the longer the movie goes , the worse it gets , but it's actually pretty good in the first few minutes . 
-1 as his circle of friends keeps getting smaller one of the characters in long time dead says 'i'm telling you , this is f * * * ed' . maybe he was reading the minds of the audience . 
+1 not a film to rival to live , but a fine little amuse-bouche to keep your appetite whetted . 
-1 it's so tedious that it makes you forgive every fake , dishonest , entertaining and , ultimately , more perceptive moment in bridget jones's diary . 
-1 not even steven spielberg has dreamed up such blatant and sickening product placement in a movie . 
+1 filmmakers dana janklowicz-mann and amir mann area headed east , far east , in retelling a historically significant , and personal , episode detailing how one international city welcomed tens of thousands of german jewish refugees while the world's democracie
+1 a droll , well-acted , character-driven comedy with unexpected deposits of feeling . 
-1 ihops don't pile on this much syrup . 
-1 a restrained ribisi convinces as an italian , though if ever a movie needed one of the actor's whiny jags to pump it up , this has to be among the rare ones . 
+1 proves mainly that south korean filmmakers can make undemanding action movies with all the alacrity of their hollywood counterparts . 
+1 a spiffy animated feature about an unruly adolescent boy who is yearning for adventure and a chance to prove his worth . 
-1 a misogynistic piece of filth that attempts to pass itself off as hip , young adult entertainment . 
+1 although devoid of objectivity and full of nostalgic comments from the now middle-aged participants , dogtown and z-boys has a compelling story to tell . 
+1 the production design , score and choreography are simply intoxicating . 
-1 alarms for duvall's throbbing sincerity and his elderly propensity for patting people while he talks . 
+1 not everything in this ambitious comic escapade works , but coppola , along with his sister , sofia , is a real filmmaker . it must be in the genes . 
-1  . . . just a big mess of a movie , full of images and events , but no tension or surprise . 
+1 mordantly funny and intimately knowing . . . 
+1 be patient with the lovely hush ! and your reward will be a thoughtful , emotional movie experience . 
+1 it's a beautifully accomplished lyrical meditation on a bunch of despondent and vulnerable characters living in the renown chelsea hotel . . . 
+1 norton holds the film together . 
+1 leigh's film is full of memorable performances from top to bottom . 
+1 hashiguchi vividly captures the way young japanese live now , chafing against their culture's manic mix of millennial brusqueness and undying , traditional politesse . 
+1 this is a visually stunning rumination on love , memory , history and the war between art and commerce . 
-1 the film never gets over its own investment in conventional arrangements , in terms of love , age , gender , race , and class . 
+1 dark , resonant , inventively detailed and packed with fleet turns of plot and a feast of visual amazement . 
+1 the casting of von sydow . . . is itself intacto's luckiest stroke . 
-1 its over-reliance on genre conventions , character types and formulaic conflict resolutions crushes all the goodwill it otherwise develops . 
+1 superior genre storytelling , which gets under our skin simply by crossing the nuclear line . 
+1 cannon's confidence and laid-back good spirits are , with the drumming routines , among the film's saving graces . 
+1 the modern remake of dumas's story is long on narrative and ( too ) short on action . 
-1 sheridan seems terrified of the book's irreverent energy , and scotches most of its élan , humor , bile , and irony . 
+1 moore's performance impresses almost as much as her work with haynes in 1995's safe . 
+1 just as the recent argentine film son of the bride reminded us that a feel-good movie can still show real heart , time of favor presents us with an action movie that actually has a brain . 
-1 despite all evidence to the contrary , this clunker has somehow managed to pose as an actual feature movie , the kind that charges full admission and gets hyped on tv and purports to amuse small children and ostensible adults . 
+1 leaping from one arresting image to another , songs from the second floor has all the enjoyable randomness of a very lively dream and so manages to be compelling , amusing and unsettling at the same time . 
-1 an inelegant combination of two unrelated shorts that falls far short of the director's previous work in terms of both thematic content and narrative strength . 
-1 the only upside to all of this unpleasantness is , given its labor day weekend upload , feardotcom should log a minimal number of hits . 
+1 macdowell , whose wifty southern charm has anchored lighter affairs . . . brings an absolutely riveting conviction to her role . 
+1 bogdanovich puts history in perspective and , via kirsten dunst's remarkable performance , he showcases davies as a young woman of great charm , generosity and diplomacy . 
-1 a little objectivity could have gone a long way . 
-1 the obligatory break-ups and hook-ups don't seem to have much emotional impact on the characters . 
+1 the new guy does have a heart . now , if it only had a brain . 
-1 the problem is the needlessly poor quality of its archival prints and film footage . the images lack contrast , are murky and are frequently too dark to be decipherable . 
-1 shot like a postcard and overacted with all the boozy self-indulgence that brings out the worst in otherwise talented actors . . . 
-1 we get the comedy we settle for . 
-1 a 75-minute sample of puerile rubbish that is listless , witless , and devoid of anything resembling humor . 
-1 watching austin powers in goldmember is like binging on cotton candy . it's sweet and fluffy at the time , but it may leave you feeling a little sticky and unsatisfied . 
-1 whatever the movie's sentimental , hypocritical lessons about sexism , its true colors come out in various wet t-shirt and shower scenes . 
-1 on the right track to something that's creepy and effective . . . it's just going to take more than a man in a bullwinkle costume to get there . 
+1 although mainstream american movies tend to exploit the familiar , every once in a while a film arrives from the margin that gives viewers a chance to learn , to grow , to travel . 
+1 i liked a lot of the smaller scenes . 
-1 it's played in the most straight-faced fashion , with little humor to lighten things up . the heavy-handed film is almost laughable as a consequence . 
-1 it's mired in a shabby script that piles layer upon layer of action man cliché atop wooden dialogue and a shifting tone that falls far short of the peculiarly moral amorality of [woo's] best work . 
+1 this is a movie full of grace and , ultimately , hope . 
+1 while the story does seem pretty unbelievable at times , it's awfully entertaining to watch . 
+1 the universal theme of becoming a better person through love has never been filmed more irresistibly than in 'baran . '
-1 instead of building to a laugh riot we are left with a handful of disparate funny moments of no real consequence . 
-1 aspires to the cracked lunacy of the adventures of buckaroo banzai , but thanks to an astonishingly witless script ends up more like the adventures of ford fairlane . 
+1 the 3-d vistas from orbit , with the space station suspended like a huge set of wind chimes over the great blue globe , are stanzas of breathtaking , awe-inspiring visual poetry . 
+1 as well-acted and well-intentioned as all or nothing is , however , the film comes perilously close to being too bleak , too pessimistic and too unflinching for its own good . 
+1 a brutally dry satire of middle american numbness . 
+1 if the plot seems a bit on the skinny side , that's because panic room is interested in nothing more than sucking you inand making you sweat . 
+1 though it's become almost redundant to say so , major kudos go to leigh for actually casting people who look working-class . 
+1 children may not understand everything that happens -- i'm not sure even miyazaki himself does -- but they will almost certainly be fascinated , and undoubtedly delighted . 
-1 a chiller resolutely without chills . 
-1 ram dass fierce grace moulds itself as an example to up-and-coming documentarians , of the overlooked pitfalls of such an endeavour . 
-1 despite an impressive roster of stars and direction from kathryn bigelow , the weight of water is oppressively heavy . 
+1 a mess when it comes to the characters and writing . . . but works its way underneath the skin like few movies have in recent memory . 
+1 highbrow self-appointed guardians of culture need not apply , but those who loved cool as ice have at last found a worthy follow-up . 
-1 unfortunately , as a writer , mr . montias isn't nearly as good to his crew as he is as a director or actor . 
+1 a poignant and compelling story about relationships , food of love takes us on a bumpy but satisfying journey of the heart . 
-1 christians sensitive to a reductionist view of their lord as a luv-spreading dr . feelgood or omnipotent slacker will feel vastly more affronted than secularists , who might even praise god for delivering such an instant camp classic . 
+1 the movie is hardly a masterpiece , but it does mark ms . bullock's best work in some time . 
+1 filmmaker stacy peralta has a flashy editing style that doesn't always jell with sean penn's monotone narration , but he respects the material without sentimentalizing it . 
-1 apparently designed as a reverie about memory and regret , but the only thing you'll regret is remembering the experience of sitting through it . 
-1 there's no real reason to see it , and no real reason not to . 
-1 as self-aware movies go , who is cletis tout ? is clever enough , though thin writing proves its undoing . 
-1 the project's filmmakers forgot to include anything even halfway scary as they poorly rejigger fatal attraction into a high school setting . 
-1 the irwins' scenes are fascinating ; the movie as a whole is cheap junk and an insult to their death-defying efforts . 
+1 whereas oliver stone's conspiracy thriller jfk was long , intricate , star-studded and visually flashy , interview with the assassin draws its considerable power from simplicity . 
-1 sluggish , tonally uneven . 
+1 there are times when you wish that the movie had worked a little harder to conceal its contrivances , but brown sugar turns out to be a sweet and enjoyable fantasy . 
+1 tim allen is great in his role but never hogs the scenes from his fellow cast , as there are plenty of laughs and good lines for everyone in this comedy . 
-1 it made me realize that we really haven't had a good cheesy b-movie playing in theaters since . . . well . . . since last week's reign of fire . 
+1 spare but quietly effective retelling . 
-1 never decides whether it wants to be a black comedy , drama , melodrama or some combination of the three . 
+1 this may not have the dramatic gut-wrenching impact of other holocaust films , but it's a compelling story , mainly because of the way it's told by the people who were there . 
+1 with not a lot of help from the screenplay ( proficient , but singularly cursory ) , [testud] acts with the feral intensity of the young bette davis . 
+1 the movie is not as terrible as the synergistic impulse that created it . 
-1 'butterfingered' is the word for the big-fisted direction of jez butterworth , who manages to blast even the smallest sensitivities from the romance with his clamorous approach .
