-1 busy urban comedy is clearly not zhang's forte , his directorial touch is neither light nor magical enough to bring off this kind of whimsy . 
-1 a plodding look at the french revolution through the eyes of aristocrats . 
-1 this idea has lost its originality . . . and neither star appears very excited at rehashing what was basically a one-joke picture . 
-1 even if it made its original release date last fall , it would've reeked of a been-there , done-that sameness . 
+1 viewers of " the ring " are more likely to remember the haunting images than the plot holes . 
-1 4ever has the same sledgehammer appeal as pokemon videos , but it breathes more on the big screen and induces headaches more slowly . 
-1 carrying this wafer-thin movie on his nimble shoulders , chan wades through putrid writing , direction and timing with a smile that says , 'if i stay positive , maybe i can channel one of my greatest pictures , drunken master . '
-1 gooding offers a desperately ingratiating performance . 
+1 it's a demented kitsch mess ( although the smeary digital video does match the muddled narrative ) , but it's savvy about celebrity and has more guts and energy than much of what will open this year . 
-1 you know that ten bucks you'd spend on a ticket ? just send it to cranky . we don't get paid enough to sit through crap like this . 
-1 god help the poor woman if attal is this insecure in real life : his fictional yvan's neuroses are aggravating enough to exhaust the patience of even the most understanding spouse . 
+1 candid and comfortable ; a film that deftly balances action and reflection as it lets you grasp and feel the passion others have for their work . 
-1 a disaster of a drama , saved only by its winged assailants . 
+1 you can feel the heat that ignites this gripping tale , and the humor and humanity that root it in feeling . 
+1 an absurdist spider web . 
-1 though there are many tense scenes in trapped , they prove more distressing than suspenseful . 
+1 made me unintentionally famous  as the queasy-stomached critic who staggered from the theater and blacked out in the lobby . but believe it or not , it's one of the most beautiful , evocative works i've seen . 
+1 a return to pure disney magic and is enjoyable family fare . 
+1 instead of hitting the audience over the head with a moral , schrader relies on subtle ironies and visual devices to convey point of view . 
+1 one of the best inside-show-biz yarns ever . 
+1 it's a testament to de niro and director michael caton-jones that by movie's end , we accept the characters and the film , flaws and all . 
+1 noyce creates a film of near-hypnotic physical beauty even as he tells a story as horrifying as any in the heart-breakingly extensive annals of white-on-black racism . 
-1 they presume their audience won't sit still for a sociology lesson , however entertainingly presented , so they trot out the conventional science-fiction elements of bug-eyed monsters and futuristic women in skimpy clothes . 
+1 despite the predictable parent vs . child coming-of-age theme , first-class , natural acting and a look at " the real americans " make this a charmer . 
-1 sadly , 'garth' hasn't progressed as nicely as 'wayne . '
-1 the code talkers deserved better than a hollow tribute . 
-1 i realized that no matter how fantastic reign of fire looked , its story was making no sense at all . 
-1 from the choppy editing to the annoying score to 'special effects' by way of replacing objects in a character's hands below the camera line , " besotted " is misbegotten
-1 it's a mystery how the movie could be released in this condition . 
-1 a bloated gasbag thesis grotesquely impressed by its own gargantuan aura of self-importance . . . 
-1 stealing harvard will dip into your wallet , swipe 90 minutes of your time , and offer you precisely this in recompense : a few early laughs scattered around a plot as thin as it is repetitious . 
+1 if you like blood , guts and crazy beasts stalking men with guns though . . . you will likely enjoy this monster . 
+1 it's an exhilarating place to visit , this laboratory of laughter . 
+1 ferrara's best film in years . 
-1 takes a clunky tv-movie approach to detailing a chapter in the life of the celebrated irish playwright , poet and drinker . 
+1 a realistically terrifying movie that puts another notch in the belt of the long list of renegade-cop tales . 
+1 one from the heart . 
+1 this version does justice both to stevenson and to the sci-fi genre . 
-1 it's too long , too repetitive , and takes way too many years to resolve to be a total winner . 
-1 the latest adam sandler assault and possibly the worst film of the year . 
+1 it might be tempting to regard mr . andrew and his collaborators as oddballs , but mr . earnhart's quizzical , charming movie allows us to see them , finally , as artists . 
+1 a dark , quirky road movie that constantly defies expectation . 
+1 alternating between facetious comic parody and pulp melodrama , this smart-aleck movie . . . tosses around some intriguing questions about the difference between human and android life . 
-1 mindless yet impressively lean spinoff of last summer's bloated effects fest the mummy returns . 
+1 on its own staggeringly unoriginal terms , this gender-bending comedy is generally quite funny . 
+1 both an admirable reconstruction of terrible events , and a fitting memorial to the dead of that day , and of the thousands thereafter . 
-1 while it is welcome to see a chinese film depict a homosexual relationship in a mature and frank fashion , lan yu never catches dramatic fire . 
+1 it would take a complete moron to foul up a screen adaptation of oscar wilde's classic satire . 
-1 once the expectation of laughter has been quashed by whatever obscenity is at hand , even the funniest idea isn't funny . 
-1 strident and inelegant in its 'message-movie' posturing . 
-1 it's not nearly as fresh or enjoyable as its predecessor , but there are enough high points to keep this from being a complete waste of time . 
+1 the story is a rather simplistic one : grief drives her , love drives him , and a second chance to find love in the most unlikely place - it struck a chord in me . 
+1 smart , funny and just honest enough to provide the pleasures of a slightly naughty , just-above-average off- broadway play . 
+1 good-naturedly cornball sequel . 
-1 less a study in madness or love than a study in schoolgirl obsession . 
+1 even though many of these guys are less than adorable ( their lamentations are pretty much self-centered ) , there's something vital about the movie . 
+1 ofrece una buena oportunidad de cultura ( aunque sea condensada ) que bien vale la pena aprovechar . 
+1 singer/composer bryan adams contributes a slew of songs  a few potential hits , a few more simply intrusive to the story  but the whole package certainly captures the intended , er , spirit of the piece . 
-1 if you really want to understand what this story is really all about , you're far better served by the source material . 
+1 it's anchored by splendid performances from an honored screen veteran and a sparkling newcomer who instantly transform themselves into a believable mother/daughter pair . 
+1 a compassionate , moving portrait of an american ( and an america ) always reaching for something just outside his grasp . 
+1 a riveting documentary . 
+1 gangs , despite the gravity of its subject matter , is often as fun to watch as a good spaghetti western . 
-1 an unintentionally surreal kid's picture . . . in which actors in bad bear suits enact a sort of inter-species parody of a vh1 behind the music episode . 
-1 fails to bring as much to the table . 
+1 a sweet-natured reconsideration of one of san francisco's most vital , if least widely recognized , creative fountainheads . 
+1 a spunky , original take on a theme that will resonate with singles of many ages . 
+1 miyazaki's nonstop images are so stunning , and his imagination so vivid , that the only possible complaint you could have about spirited away is that there is no rest period , no timeout . 
+1 building slowly and subtly , the film , sporting a breezy spontaneity and realistically drawn characterizations , develops into a significant character study that is both moving and wise . 
+1 it is intensely personal and yet -- unlike quills -- deftly shows us the temper of the times . 
-1 it's about following your dreams , no matter what your parents think . socrates motions for hemlock . 
+1 robinson's web of suspense matches the page-turning frenzy that clancy creates . 
-1 just too silly and sophomoric to ensnare its target audience . 
-1 it is depressing , ruthlessly pained and depraved , the movie equivalent of staring into an open wound . 
+1 throwing caution to the wind with an invitation to the hedonist in us all , nair has constructed this motion picture in such a way that even the most cynical curmudgeon with find himself or herself smiling at one time or another . 
-1 a peculiar misfire that even tunney can't save . 
-1 kim ki-deok seems to have in mind an ( emotionally at least ) adolescent audience demanding regular shocks and bouts of barely defensible sexual violence to keep it interested . 
-1 there are plot holes big enough for shamu the killer whale to swim through . 
+1 eric byler's nuanced pic avoids easy sentiments and explanations . . . 
-1 pretty much sucks , but has a funny moment or two . 
+1 guaranteed to move anyone who ever shook , rattled , or rolled . 
-1 if this is an example of the type of project that robert redford's lab is willing to lend its imprimatur to , then perhaps it's time to rethink independent films . 
+1 a small movie with a big heart . 
-1 if you're a crocodile hunter fan , you'll enjoy at least the " real " portions of the film . if you're looking for a story , don't bother . 
+1 while most films these days are about nothing , this film seems to be about everything that's plaguing the human spirit in a relentlessly globalizing world . 
+1  . . . a visually seductive , unrepentantly trashy take on rice's second installment of her vampire chronicles . 
-1 the film's lack of personality permeates all its aspects  from the tv movie-esque , affected child acting to the dullest irish pub scenes ever filmed . 
+1 a lovely and beautifully photographed romance . 
-1 for all its impressive craftsmanship , and despite an overbearing series of third-act crescendos , lily chou-chou never really builds up a head of emotional steam . 
+1  . . . the one thing this wild film has that other imax films don't : chimps , lots of chimps , all blown up to the size of a house . that's fun for kids of any age . 
-1 loses its sense of humor in a vat of failed jokes , twitchy acting , and general boorishness . 
-1 it's just plain lurid when it isn't downright silly . 
-1 i never thought i'd say this , but i'd much rather watch teens poking their genitals into fruit pies ! 
-1 it wraps up a classic mother/daughter struggle in recycled paper with a shiny new bow and while the audience can tell it's not all new , at least it looks pretty . 
-1 plays like the old disease-of-the-week small-screen melodramas . 
-1 poor ben bratt couldn't find stardom if mapquest emailed him point-to-point driving directions . 
-1  . . . a cheap , ludicrous attempt at serious horror . 
-1 one of the most incoherent features in recent memory . 
-1 fairly successful at faking some pretty cool stunts but a complete failure at trying to create some pretty cool characters . and forget about any attempt at a plot ! 
-1 a cheerful enough but imminently forgettable rip-off of [besson's] earlier work . 
+1 quitting delivers a sucker-punch , and its impact is all the greater beause director zhang's last film , the cuddly shower , was a non-threatening multi-character piece centered around a public bath house . 
-1 the setting turns out to be more interesting than any of the character dramas , which never reach satisfying conclusions . 
-1 parker should be commended for taking a fresh approach to familiar material , but his determination to remain true to the original text leads him to adopt a somewhat mannered tone . . . that ultimately dulls the human tragedy at the story's core . 
-1 this is the sort of low-grade dreck that usually goes straight to video --with a lousy script , inept direction , pathetic acting , poorly dubbed dialogue and murky cinematography , complete with visible boom mikes . 
+1 a flick about our infantilized culture that isn't entirely infantile . 
-1 was that movie nothing more than a tepid exercise in trotting out a formula that worked five years ago but has since lost its fizz ? 
-1 what [frei] gives us . . . is a man who uses the damage of war -- far more often than the warfare itself -- to create the kind of art shots that fill gallery shows . 
+1 a great comedy filmmaker knows great comedy needn't always make us laugh . tim story's not there yet - but 'barbershop' shows he's on his way . 
-1 'christian bale's quinn [is] a leather clad grunge-pirate with a hairdo like gandalf in a wind-tunnel and a simply astounding cor-blimey-luv-a-duck cockney accent . '
+1 both lead performances are oscar-size . quaid is utterly fearless as the tortured husband living a painful lie , and moore wonderfully underplays the long-suffering heroine with an unflappable '50s dignity somewhere between jane wyman and june cleaver . 
-1  . . . silly humbuggery . . . 
-1 might have been better off as a documentary , with less of mr . eyre's uninspired dramatics and more of his sense of observation and outrage . 
-1 the film is so packed with subplots involving the various silbersteins that it feels more like the pilot episode of a tv series than a feature film . 
+1 an impressive if flawed effort that indicates real talent . 
+1 [russell] makes good b movies ( the mask , the blob ) , and the scorpion king more than ably meets those standards . 
+1 generally , clockstoppers will fulfill your wildest fantasies about being a different kind of time traveler , while happily killing 94 minutes . 
+1 the beautifully choreographed kitchen ballet is simple but absorbing . 
-1 it's difficult to conceive of anyone who has reached puberty actually finding the characters in slackers or their antics amusing , let alone funny . 
-1 imagine a really bad community theater production of west side story without the songs . 
+1 not quite as miraculous as its dreamworks makers would have you believe , but it more than adequately fills the eyes and stirs the emotions . 
-1 has all the poignancy of a hallmark card and all the comedy of a gallagher stand-up act . 
+1 lilia's transformation from strict mother to sensual siren is superficially preposterous , but abbas infuses the role with an unimpeachable core of emotional truth . 
-1 the title not only describes its main characters , but the lazy people behind the camera as well . 
-1 it's as if allen , at 66 , has stopped challenging himself . 
-1 to paraphrase a line from another dickens' novel , nicholas nickleby is too much like a fragment of an underdone potato . 
-1 judd's characters ought to pick up the durable best seller smart women , foolish choices for advice . 
-1 every nanosecond of the the new guy reminds you that you could be doing something else far more pleasurable . something like scrubbing the toilet . or emptying rat traps . or doing last year's taxes with your ex-wife . 
-1 involves two mysteries -- one it gives away and the other featuring such badly drawn characters that its outcome hardly matters . 
+1 ranks among willams' best screen work . 
-1  . . . the good and different idea [of middle-aged romance] is not handled well and , except for the fine star performances , there is little else to recommend " never again . " 
-1 the movie is as far as you can get from racy , to the point where it almost stops the blood flow to your brain ; it has a dull , costumey feel . 
+1 a keep-'em-guessing plot and an affectionate take on its screwed-up characters . 
-1 the skills of a calculus major at m . i . t . are required to balance all the formulaic equations in the long-winded heist comedy who is cletis tout ? 
+1 a simple , but gritty and well-acted ensemble drama that encompasses a potent metaphor for a country still dealing with its fascist past . 
-1  . . . nothing scary here except for some awful acting and lame special effects . 
+1 the acting alone is worth the price of admission . 
-1 it all unfolds predictably , and the adventures that happen along the way seem repetitive and designed to fill time , providing no real sense of suspense . 
-1 the movie's accumulated force still feels like an ugly knot tightening in your stomach . but is that knot from dramatic tension or a symptom of artistic malnutrition ? 
-1 i can't remember the last time i saw an audience laugh so much during a movie , but there's only one problemit's supposed to be a drama . 
+1 must be seen to be believed . 
-1 the creaking , rusty ship makes a fine backdrop , but the ghosts' haunting is routine . 
-1 if we don't demand a standard of quality for the art that we choose , we deserve the trash that we get . 
+1  . . . tunney is allowed to build an uncommonly human character , an almost real-live girl complete with trouble and hope . 
+1 a melancholy , emotional film . 
+1 a droll , bitchy frolic which pokes fun at the price of popularity and small-town pretension in the lone star state . 
-1 despite some charm and heart , this quirky soccer import is forgettable
-1 those who managed to avoid the deconstructionist theorizing of french philosopher jacques derrida in college can now take an 85-minute brush-up course with the documentary derrida . or , you can do something fun tonight . 
-1 there are simply too many ideas floating around -- part farce , part sliding doors , part pop video -- and yet failing to exploit them . 
+1 the animated sequences are well done and perfectly constructed to convey a sense of childhood imagination and creating adventure out of angst . 
-1 in the end , the film feels homogenized and a bit contrived , as if we're looking back at a tattered and ugly past with rose-tinted glasses . 
+1 while [roman coppola] scores points for style , he staggers in terms of story . 
+1 it's not life-affirming  its vulgar and mean , but i liked it . 
-1 at 90 minutes this movie is short , but it feels much longer . 
+1 if the man from elysian fields is doomed by its smallness , it is also elevated by it--the kind of movie that you enjoy more because you're one of the lucky few who sought it out . 
+1 workmanlike , maybe , but still a film with all the elements that made the other three great , scary times at the movies . 
+1 holofcener rejects patent solutions to dramatize life's messiness from inside out , in all its strange quirks . 
+1 it trusts the story it sets out to tell . 
+1 it is definitely worth seeing . 
-1 these characters become wearisome . 
-1 boyd's screenplay ( co-written with guardian hack nick davies ) has a florid turn of phrase that owes more to guy ritchie than the bard of avon . 
+1 this is lightweight filmmaking , to be sure , but it's pleasant enough -- and oozing with attractive men . 
-1 screenwriters scott abbott and michael petroni have turned rice's complex akasha into a cartoon monster . 
-1 chamber of secrets will find millions of eager fans . but if the essence of magic is its make-believe promise of life that soars above the material realm , this is the opposite of a truly magical movie . 
-1 we just don't really care too much about this love story . in that setting , their struggle is simply too ludicrous and borderline insulting . 
-1 the 50-something lovebirds are too immature and unappealing to care about . 
-1 meandering and glacially paced , and often just plain dull . 
-1 director george hickenlooper has had some success with documentaries , but here his sense of story and his juvenile camera movements smack of a film school undergrad , and his maudlin ending might not have gotten him into film school in the first place . 
-1 who are 'they' ? well , they're 'they' . they're the unnamed , easily substitutable forces that serve as whatever terror the heroes of horror movies try to avoid . they exist for hushed lines like " they're back ! " , " they're out there ! " and " they're coming ! " 
+1 reign of fire looks as if it was made without much thought -- and is best watched that way . 
-1 though a bit of a patchwork in script and production , a glossy , rich green , environment almost makes the picture work . 
+1 terrific casting and solid execution give all three stories life . 
-1 the film has a nearly terminal case of the cutes , and it's neither as funny nor as charming as it thinks it is . 
-1 without a fresh infusion of creativity , 4ever is neither a promise nor a threat so much as wishful thinking . 
-1 whether jason x is this bad on purpose is never clear . but one thing's for sure : it never comes close to being either funny or scary . 
-1 a disappointment for a movie that should have been the ultimate imax trip . 
-1 it's crap on a leash--far too polite to scale the lunatic heights of joe dante's similarly styled gremlins . 
-1 not so much funny as aggressively sitcom-cute , it's full of throwaway one-liners , not-quite jokes , and a determined tv amiability that allen personifies . 
-1 this is a movie filled with unlikable , spiteful idiots ; whether or not their friendship is salvaged makes no difference in the least . 
-1 it's neither as sappy as big daddy nor as anarchic as happy gilmore or the waterboy , but it has its moments . 
+1 brash , intelligent and erotically perplexing , haneke's portrait of an upper class austrian society and the suppression of its tucked away demons is uniquely felt with a sardonic jolt . 
-1 well before it's over , beijing bicycle begins spinning its wheels . 
+1 more than anything else , kissing jessica stein injects freshness and spirit into the romantic comedy genre , which has been held hostage by generic scripts that seek to remake sleepless in seattle again and again . 
-1 one just waits grimly for the next shock without developing much attachment to the characters . 
-1 no doubt the star and everyone else involved had their hearts in the right place . where their heads were is anyone's guess . 
+1 the best movie of its kind since 'brazil . ' lucas , take notes . this is how you use special effects . 
-1 the execution is so pedestrian that the most positive comment we can make is that rob schneider actually turns in a pretty convincing performance as a prissy teenage girl . 
+1 texan director george ratliff had unlimited access to families and church meetings , and he delivers fascinating psychological fare . 
-1 there seems to be no clear path as to where the story's going , or how long it's going to take to get there . 
-1 there may have been a good film in " trouble every day , " but it is not what is on the screen . 
-1 sets animation back 30 years , musicals back 40 years and judaism back at least 50 . 
-1 cacoyannis is perhaps too effective in creating an atmosphere of dust-caked stagnation and labored gentility . 
+1 the plot is so amusingly contrived and outlandish in its coincidences that no one could ever mistake it for anything resembling reality
+1 more than makes up for its mawkish posing by offering rousing spates of genuine feeling . 
+1 the crime matters less than the characters , although the filmmakers supply enough complications , close calls and double-crosses to satisfy us . 
-1 while the film misfires at every level , the biggest downside is the paucity of laughter in what's supposed to be a comedy . 
-1 the comedy is nonexistent . 
+1 a charming romantic comedy that is by far the lightest dogme film and among the most enjoyable . 
-1 the campy results make mel brooks' borscht belt schtick look sophisticated . 
-1 eisenstein lacks considerable brio for a film about one of cinema's directorial giants . 
+1 judith and zaza's extended bedroom sequence . . . is so intimate and sensual and funny and psychologically self-revealing that it makes most of what passes for sex in the movies look like cheap hysterics . 
+1  . . . a story we haven't seen on the big screen before , and it's a story that we as americans , and human beings , should know . 
+1 for more than two decades mr . nachtwey has traveled to places in the world devastated by war , famine and poverty and documented the cruelty and suffering he has found with an devastating , eloquent clarity . 
-1 this is an exercise not in biography but in hero worship . 
-1 conforms itself with creating a game of 'who's who' . . . where the characters' moves are often more predictable than their consequences . 
+1  . . . a delightfully unpredictable , hilarious comedy with wonderful performances that tug at your heart in ways that utterly transcend gender labels . 
+1 far from heaven is a dazzling conceptual feat , but more than that , it's a work of enthralling drama . 
-1 the kids often appear to be reading the lines and are incapable of conveying any emotion . 
+1 there is a general air of exuberance in all about the benjamins that's hard to resist . 
+1 fortunately , elling never gets too cloying thanks to the actors' perfect comic timing and sweet , genuine chemistry . 
-1 for all of its insights into the dream world of teen life , and its electronic expression through cyber culture , the film gives no quarter to anyone seeking to pull a cohesive story out of its 2 1/2-hour running time . 
-1 even the hastily and amateurishly drawn animation cannot engage . 
-1 a perplexing example of promise unfulfilled , despite many charming moments . 
-1 if you collected all the moments of coherent dialogue , they still wouldn't add up to the time required to boil a four- minute egg . 
-1 though the book runs only about 300 pages , it is so densely packed . . . that even an ambitious adaptation and elaborate production like mr . schepisi's seems skimpy and unclear . 
+1 brosnan gives a portrayal as solid and as perfect as his outstanding performance as bond in die another day . 
-1 a direct-to-void release , heading nowhere . 
+1 'charly' will divide its audience in two separate groups , those reaching for more tissues and those begging for mercy . . . 
-1  . . . a complete shambles of a movie so sloppy , so uneven , so damn unpleasant that i can't believe any viewer , young or old , would have a good time here . 
+1 shyamalan takes a potentially trite and overused concept ( aliens come to earth ) and infuses it into a rustic , realistic , and altogether creepy tale of hidden invasion . 
-1 godard uses his characters -- if that's not too glorified a term -- as art things , mouthpieces , visual motifs , blanks . 
-1 most of the film feels conceived and shot on the fly -- like between lunch breaks for shearer's radio show and his simpson voice-overs . 
-1 i could just feel the screenwriter at every moment 'tap , tap , tap , tap , tapping away' on this screenplay . 
+1 those who would follow haneke on his creepy explorations . . . are rewarded by brutal , committed performances from huppert and magimel . 
+1 seldom has a movie so closely matched the spirit of a man and his work . 
+1 can be viewed as pure composition and form -- film as music
+1 high crimes knows the mistakes that bad movies make and is determined not to make them , and maybe that is nobility of a sort . 
+1 a well-made thriller with a certain level of intelligence and non-reactionary morality . 
-1 the plot is paper-thin and the characters aren't interesting enough to watch them go about their daily activities for two whole hours . 
+1 chilling , well-acted , and finely directed : david jacobson's dahmer . 
-1 the humor isn't as sharp , the effects not as innovative , nor the story as imaginative as in the original . but it could have been worse . 
-1 as spent screen series go , star trek : nemesis is even more suggestive of a 65th class reunion mixer where only eight surviving members show up -- and there's nothing to drink . 
+1 much credit must be given to the water-camera operating team of don king , sonny miller , and michael stewart . their work is fantastic . 
+1 a beguiling evocation of the quality that keeps dickens evergreen : the exuberant openness with which he expresses our most basic emotions . 
+1 i had more fun watching spy than i had with most of the big summer movies . 
+1 excellent performances from jacqueline bisset and martha plimpton grace this deeply touching melodrama . 
+1 fontaine's direction , especially her agreeably startling use of close-ups and her grace with a moving camera , creates sheerly cinematic appeal . 
-1 ultimately , sarah's dedication to finding her husband seems more psychotic than romantic , and nothing in the movie makes a convincing case that one woman's broken heart outweighs all the loss we witness . 
-1 calculated swill . 
-1 an overemphatic , would-be wacky , ultimately tedious sex farce . 
+1 es divertida , visualmente espectacular y muy entretenida . simple y sencillamente te sorprenderá . 
+1 effective but too-tepid biopic
+1 it's stylishly directed with verve . . . 
-1 bland but harmless . 
+1 superbly photographed and staged by mendes with a series of riveting set pieces the likes of which mainstream audiences have rarely seen . 
+1 this isn't a retooled genre piece , the tale of a guy and his gun , but an amiably idiosyncratic work . 
+1 nachtwey clears the cynicism right out of you . he makes you realize that deep inside righteousness can be found a tough beauty . 
-1 i've heard that the fans of the first men in black have come away hating the second one . i wonder why . they felt like the same movie to me . 
+1 what sets ms . birot's film apart from others in the genre is a greater attention to the parents -- and particularly the fateful fathers -- in the emotional evolution of the two bewitched adolescents . 
-1 this kiddie-oriented stinker is so bad that i even caught the gum stuck under my seat trying to sneak out of the theater
+1 about a boy vividly recalls the cary grant of room for one more , houseboat and father goose in its affectionate depiction of the gentle war between a reluctant , irresponsible man and the kid who latches onto him . 
+1 the difference between cho and most comics is that her confidence in her material is merited . 
+1 a slick , skillful little horror film . 
-1 plods along , minus the twisted humor and eye-popping visuals that have made miike . . . a cult hero . 
-1 at the very least , if you don't know anything about derrida when you walk into the theater , you won't know much more when you leave . 
-1 will undoubtedly play well in european markets , where mr . besson is a brand name , and in asia , where ms . shu is an institution , but american audiences will probably find it familiar and insufficiently cathartic . 
+1 if you can swallow its absurdities and crudities lagaan really is enormously good fun . 
+1 the auteur's ear for the way fears and slights are telegraphed in the most blithe exchanges gives the film its lingering tug . 
+1 the picture uses humor and a heartfelt conviction to tell a story about discovering your destination in life , but also acknowledging the places , and the people , from whence you came . 
+1 a funny , triumphant , and moving documentary . 
-1 seems like something american and european gay movies were doing 20 years ago . 
+1 as underwater ghost stories go , below casts its spooky net out into the atlantic ocean and spits it back , grizzled and charred , somewhere northwest of the bermuda triangle . 
-1 outrageousness is all plympton seemed to be going for this time . we miss the quirky amazement that used to come along for an integral part of the ride . 
-1 what's surprising about this traditional thriller , moderately successful but not completely satisfying , is exactly how genteel and unsurprising the execution turns out to be . 
-1 koepp's screenplay isn't nearly surprising or clever enough to sustain a reasonable degree of suspense on its own . 
-1 the big finish is a bit like getting all excited about a chocolate eclair and then biting into it and finding the filling missing . 
-1 the story is lacking any real emotional impact , and the plot is both contrived and cliched . 
-1 the movie is concocted and carried out by folks worthy of scorn , and the nicest thing i can say is that i can't remember a single name responsible for it . 
-1 the irwins emerge unscathed , but the fictional footage is unconvincing and criminally badly acted . 
-1 sandra bullock , despite downplaying her good looks , carries a little too much ain't- she-cute baggage into her lead role as a troubled and determined homicide cop to quite pull off the heavy stuff .

+1 [a] wonderfully loopy tale of love , longing , and voting . 
-1 better at putting you to sleep than a sound machine . 
+1 this is a startling film that gives you a fascinating , albeit depressing view of iranian rural life close to the iraqi border . 
-1 with miscast leads , banal dialogue and an absurdly overblown climax , killing me softly belongs firmly in the so-bad-it's-good camp . 
-1 everything is off . 
+1 it's a beautiful film , full of elaborate and twisted characters - and it's also pretty funny . 
-1 an intermittently pleasing but mostly routine effort . 
+1 with three excellent principal singers , a youthful and good-looking diva and tenor and richly handsome locations , it's enough to make you wish jacquot had left well enough alone and just filmed the opera without all these distortions of perspective . 
+1 you live the mood rather than savour the story . 
+1 everything you loved about it in 1982 is still there , for everybody who wants to be a kid again , or show it to their own kids . 
+1 just offbeat enough to keep you interested without coming close to bowling you over . 
-1 the only thing " swept away " is the one hour and thirty-three minutes spent watching this waste of time . 
+1 it made me want to get made-up and go see this movie with my sisters . i thought the relationships were wonderful , the comedy was funny , and the love 'real' . 
-1 it is not the first time that director sara sugarman stoops to having characters drop their pants for laughs and not the last time she fails to provoke them . 
+1 not only a reminder of how they used to make movies , but also how they sometimes still can be made . 
-1 lame , haphazard teen comedy . 
+1 despite the film's shortcomings , the stories are quietly moving . 
-1 like a pack of dynamite sticks , built for controversy . the film is explosive , but a few of those sticks are wet . 
+1 an intelligent romantic thriller of a very old-school kind of quality . 
-1 all in all , road to perdition is more in love with strangeness than excellence . 
+1 reggio's continual visual barrage is absorbing as well as thought-provoking . 
-1 to say that this vapid vehicle is downright doltish and uneventful is just as obvious as telling a country skunk that he has severe body odor . 
+1 this is an undeniably intriguing film from an adventurous young talent who finds his inspiration on the fringes of the american underground . 
-1 none of this has the suavity or classical familiarity of bond , but much of it is good for a laugh . the problem with " xxx " is that its own action isn't very effective . 
-1 once she lets her love depraved leads meet , [denis'] story becomes a hopeless , unsatisfying muddle
-1 the words , 'frankly , my dear , i don't give a damn , ' have never been more appropriate . 
+1 the pianist lacks the quick emotional connections of steven spielberg's schindler's list . but mr . polanski creates images even more haunting than those in mr . spielberg's 1993 classic . 
+1 it may not be " last tango in paris " but . . . 
+1 full of surprises . 
+1 a solidly seaworthy chiller . 
-1 adroit but finally a trifle flat , mad love doesn't galvanize its outrage the way , say , jane campion might have done , but at least it possesses some . 
+1 passionate , irrational , long-suffering but cruel as a tarantula , helga figures prominently in this movie , and helps keep the proceedings as funny for grown-ups as for rugrats . 
+1 flawed but worthy look at life in u . s . relocation camps . 
+1 [a] rare , beautiful film . 
+1 its compelling mix of trial movie , escape movie and unexpected fable ensures the film never feels draggy . 
-1 degenerates into hogwash . 
+1 abderrahmane sissako's heremakono ( waiting for happiness ) is an elegiac portrait of a transit city on the west african coast struggling against foreign influences . 
+1 as literary desecrations go , this makes for perfectly acceptable , occasionally very enjoyable children's entertainment . you'll forget about it by monday , though , and if they're old enough to have developed some taste , so will your kids . 
+1 despite its shortcomings , girls can't swim represents an engaging and intimate first feature by a talented director to watch , and it's a worthy entry in the french coming-of-age genre . 
-1 while it's all quite tasteful to look at , the attention process tends to do a little fleeing of its own . 
-1 madonna has made herself over so often now , there's apparently nothing left to work with , sort of like michael jackson's nose . 
-1 fairly run-of-the-mill . 
-1 bella is the picture of health with boundless energy until a few days before she dies . this is absolutely and completely ridiculous and an insult to every family whose mother has suffered through the horrible pains of a death by cancer . 
+1 peppered with witty dialogue and inventive moments . 
+1 compellingly watchable . 
+1 the film benefits greatly from a less manic tone than its predecessor , as cho appears to have settled comfortably into her skin . 
-1 there is simply not enough of interest onscreen to sustain its seventy-minute running time . 
-1 here's a self-congratulatory 3d imax rah-rah . 
+1 it's hard to imagine alan arkin being better than he is in this performance . 
+1 a delightful stimulus for the optic nerves , so much that it's forgivable that the plot feels like every other tale of a totalitarian tomorrow . 
-1 everything -- even life on an aircraft carrier -- is sentimentalized . 
-1 even if britney spears is really cute , her movie is really bad . 
-1  . . . plot holes so large and obvious a marching band might as well be stomping through them in clown clothes , playing a college football fight song on untuned instruments . 
-1 much of the digitally altered footage appears jagged , as if filmed directly from a television monitor , while the extensive use of stock footage quickly becomes a tiresome cliché . 
-1 represents the depths to which the girls-behaving-badly film has fallen . 
-1 largely , this is a movie that also does it by the numbers . 
-1 not once in the rush to save the day did i become very involved in the proceedings ; to me , it was just a matter of 'eh . '
+1 the delicious trimmingsarrive early and stay late , filling nearly every minutewith a lighthearted glow , some impudent snickers , and a glorious dose of humankind's liberating ability to triumph over a scrooge or two . 
+1 an intoxicating experience . 
+1 a small gem from belgium . 
-1 skip this turd and pick your nose instead because you're sure to get more out of the latter experience . 
-1 it doesn't help that the director and cinematographer stephen kazmierski shoot on grungy video , giving the whole thing a dirty , tasteless feel . 
+1 despite its hawaiian setting , the science-fiction trimmings and some moments of rowdy slapstick , the basic plot of " lilo " could have been pulled from a tear-stained vintage shirley temple script . 
+1 its scenes and sensibility are all more than familiar , but it exudes a kind of nostalgic spy-movie charm and , at the same time , is so fresh and free of the usual thriller nonsense that it all seems to be happening for the first time . 
+1 michel piccoli's moving performance is this films reason for being . 
+1 hatfield and hicks make the oddest of couples , and in this sense the movie becomes a study of the gambles of the publishing world , offering a case study that exists apart from all the movie's political ramifications . 
+1 it's one of the saddest films i have ever seen that still manages to be uplifting but not overly sentimental . 
+1 divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood may not be exactly divine , but it's definitely -- defiantly -- ya ya , what with all of those terrific songs and spirited performances . 
+1 the story and structure are well-honed . fresnadillo's dark and jolting images have a way of plying into your subconscious like the nightmare you had a week ago that won't go away . 
+1 [fiji diver rusi vulakoro and the married couple howard and michelle hall] show us the world they love and make us love it , too . 
+1 writer-director juan carlos fresnadillo makes a feature debut that is fully formed and remarkably assured . 
+1 this is the best american movie about troubled teens since 1998's whatever . 
+1 most of the things that made the original men in black such a pleasure are still there . 
+1 you needn't be steeped in '50s sociology , pop culture or movie lore to appreciate the emotional depth of haynes' work . though haynes' style apes films from the period . . . its message is not rooted in that decade . 
-1 the obnoxious special effects , the obligatory outbursts of flatulence and the incessant , so-five-minutes-ago pop music on the soundtrack overwhelm what is left of the scruffy , dopey old hanna-barbera charm . 
-1 devoid of any of the qualities that made the first film so special . 
-1 there's a neat twist , subtly rendered , that could have wrapped things up at 80 minutes , but kang tacks on three or four more endings . 
+1 an important movie , a reminder of the power of film to move us and to make us examine our values . 
+1 [kline's] utterly convincing -- and deeply appealing -- as a noble teacher who embraces a strict moral code , and as a flawed human being who can't quite live up to it . 
+1 daughter from danang reveals that efforts toward closure only open new wounds . it doesn't flinch from its unsettling prognosis , namely , that the legacy of war is a kind of perpetual pain . 
+1 peppering this urban study with references to norwegian folktales , villeneuve creates in maelstrom a world where the bizarre is credible and the real turns magical . 
+1 the more you think about the movie , the more you will probably like it . 
+1 one can't deny its seriousness and quality . 
+1 spectacularly beautiful , not to mention mysterious , sensual , emotionally intense , and replete with virtuoso throat-singing . 
-1 could as easily have been called 'under siege 3 : in alcatraz' . . . a cinematic corpse that never springs to life . 
-1 the pretensions -- and disposable story -- sink the movie . and diesel isn't the actor to save it . 
+1 tells ( the story ) with such atmospheric ballast that shrugging off the plot's persnickety problems is simply a matter of ( being ) in a shrugging mood . 
-1 the talk-heavy film plays like one of robert altman's lesser works . 
+1 a brilliant , absurd collection of vignettes that , in their own idiosyncratic way , sum up the strange horror of life in the new millennium . 
-1 there's no excuse for following up a delightful , well-crafted family film with a computer-generated cold fish . 
-1 ruh-roh ! romething's really wrong with this ricture ! 
-1 weiss and speck never make a convincing case for the relevance of these two 20th-century footnotes . 
-1 everything was as superficial as the forced new jersey lowbrow accent uma had . 
+1 this new movie version of the alexandre dumas classic is the stuff of high romance , brought off with considerable wit . 
-1  . . . contains very few laughs and even less surprises . 
+1 apart from anything else , this is one of the best-sustained ideas i have ever seen on the screen . 
+1 fans of the modern day hong kong action film finally have the worthy successor to a better tomorrow and the killer which they have been patiently waiting for . 
+1 monte cristo smartly emphasizes the well-wrought story and omits needless chase scenes and swordfights as the revenge unfolds . 
-1 the animation merely serves up a predictable , maudlin story that swipes heavily from bambi and the lion king , yet lacks the emotional resonance of either of those movies . 
-1 as with so many merchandised-to-the-max movies of this type , more time appears to have gone into recruiting the right bands for the playlist and the costuming of the stars than into the script , which has a handful of smart jokes and not much else . 
-1 thoughtless , random , superficial humour and a lot of very bad scouse accents
+1 ozpetek's effort has the scope and shape of an especially well-executed television movie . 
-1 an unencouraging threefold expansion on the former mtv series , accompanying the stunt-hungry dimwits in a random series of collected gags , pranks , pratfalls , dares , injuries , etc . 
-1 summer's far too fleeting to squander on offal like this . 
-1  . . . no charm , no laughs , no fun , no reason to watch . 
+1 an enjoyable experience . 
+1  . . . has freaky scenes where the crew wonder if they're ghosts imagining themselves as alive . it's a sly wink to the others without becoming a postmodern joke , made creepy by its " men in a sardine can " warped logic . 
-1 it's supposed to be post-feminist breezy but ends up as tedious as the chatter of parrots raised on oprah . 
-1 granddad of le nouvelle vague , jean-luc godard continues to baffle the faithful with his games of hide-and-seek . 
-1 the château would have been benefited from a sharper , cleaner script before it went in front of the camera . not to mention a sharper , cleaner camera lens . 
-1 a sophomoric exploration of 'life problems' most people solved long ago -- or at least got tired of hearing people kvetch about . 
-1 imagine ( if possible ) a pasolini film without passion or politics , or an almodovar movie without beauty or humor , and you have some idea of the glum , numb experience of watching o fantasma . 
+1 personal velocity has a no-frills docu-dogma plainness , yet miller lingers on invisible , nearly psychic nuances , leaping into digressions of memory and desire . she boxes these women's souls right open for us . 
+1 the way the roundelay of partners functions , and the interplay within partnerships and among partnerships and the general air of gator-bashing are consistently delightful . 
-1 alternative medicine obviously has its merits . . . but ayurveda does the field no favors . 
+1  ( a ) hollywood sheen bedevils the film from the very beginning . . . ( but ) lohman's moist , deeply emotional eyes shine through this bogus veneer . . . 
+1 that old adage about women being unknowable gets an exhilarating new interpretation in morvern callar . 
+1 spider-man is in the same category as x-men - occasionally brilliant but mostly average , showing signs of potential for the sequels , but not giving us much this time around . 
-1 this is standard crime drama fare . . . instantly forgettable and thoroughly dull . 
+1 jaglom . . . put[s] the audience in the privileged position of eavesdropping on his characters
-1 cherry orchard is badly edited , often awkwardly directed and suffers from the addition of a wholly unnecessary pre-credit sequence designed to give some of the characters a 'back story . '
+1 shyamalan offers copious hints along the way -- myriad signs , if you will -- that beneath the familiar , funny surface is a far bigger , far more meaningful story than one in which little green men come to earth for harvesting purposes . 
-1 it cannot be enjoyed , even on the level that one enjoys a bad slasher flick , primarily because it is dull . yes , dull . 
-1 meyjes focuses too much on max when he should be filling the screen with this tortured , dull artist and monster-in-the- making . 
-1 a so-so , made-for-tv something posing as a real movie . 
+1 max pokes , provokes , takes expressionistic license and hits a nerve . . . as far as art is concerned , it's mission accomplished . 
-1 disney again ransacks its archives for a quick-buck sequel . 
-1 true to its title , it traps audiences in a series of relentlessly nasty situations that we would pay a considerable ransom not to be looking at . 
-1 it's young guns meets goodfellas in this easily skippable hayseeds-vs . -greaseballs mob action-comedy . 
+1 often hilarious . 
+1 it doesn't make for great cinema , but it is interesting to see where one's imagination will lead when given the opportunity . 
+1 there's nothing like love to give a movie a b-12 shot , and cq shimmers with it . 
+1 it may not be history  but then again , what if it is ?  but it makes for one of the most purely enjoyable and satisfying evenings at the movies i've had in a while . 
-1 hilarious musical comedy though stymied by accents thick as mud . 
+1 all three actresses are simply dazzling , particularly balk , who's finally been given a part worthy of her considerable talents . 
-1 as [the characters] get more depressed , the story gets more tiresome , especially as it continues to mount a conspicuous effort to be profound . 
-1  coarse , cliched and clunky , this trifling romantic comedy in which opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it squanders the charms of stars hugh grant and sandra bullock . 
+1 a miraculous movie , i'm going home is so slight , yet overflows with wisdom and emotion . 
-1 it just goes to show , an intelligent person isn't necessarily an admirable storyteller . 
-1 so lazy and slipshod it confuses the mere flashing of kinky soft-core imagery with naughty fun . 
+1 it is a challenging film , if not always a narratively cohesive one . 
-1 a sloppy slapstick throwback to long gone bottom-of-the-bill fare like the ghost and mr . chicken . 
-1 supposedly based upon real , or at least soberly reported incidents , the film ends with a large human tragedy . alas , getting there is not even half the interest . 
+1 a flawed but engrossing thriller . 
-1 as pedestrian as they come . 
+1 poignant if familiar story of a young person suspended between two cultures . 
+1 a much more successful translation than its most famous previous film adaptation , writer-director anthony friedman's similarly updated 1970 british production . 
+1 spinning a web of dazzling entertainment may be overstating it , but " spider-man " certainly delivers the goods . 
-1 a shame that stealing harvard is too busy getting in its own way to be anything but frustrating , boring , and forgettable . 
-1 nair just doesn't have the necessary self-control to guide a loose , poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy . 
-1 as plain and pedestrian as catsup--
-1 [janey] forgets about her other obligations , leading to a tragedy which is somehow guessable from the first few minutes , maybe because it echoes the by now intolerable morbidity of so many recent movies . 
+1 humorous , artsy , and even cute , in an off-kilter , dark , vaguely disturbing way . 
+1 a highly personal look at the effects of living a dysfunctionally privileged lifestyle , and by the end , we only wish we could have spent more time in its world . 
-1 would that greengrass had gone a tad less for grit and a lot more for intelligibility . 
+1 the four feathers has rewards , from the exoticism of its seas of sand to the fierce grandeur of its sweeping battle scenes . 
-1 some motion pictures portray ultimate passion ; others create ultimate thrills . men in black ii achieves ultimate insignificance -- it's the sci-fi comedy spectacle as whiffle-ball epic . 
+1 as a belated nod to some neglected all-stars , standing in the shadows of motown is cultural history of the best kind : informative , revealing and richly entertaining . 
+1 chicago is sophisticated , brash , sardonic , completely joyful in its execution . 
+1 a loving little film of considerable appeal . 
-1 despite apparent motives to the contrary , it ends up being , like [seinfeld's] revered tv show , about pretty much nothing . 
-1 dogtown is hollow , self-indulgent , and - worst of all - boring . 
-1  . . . hudlin is stuck trying to light a fire with soggy leaves . 
-1 to imagine the life of harry potter as a martial arts adventure told by a lobotomized woody allen is to have some idea of the fate that lies in store for moviegoers lured to the mediocrity that is kung pow : enter the fist . 
-1 the problem with this film is that it lacks focus . i sympathize with the plight of these families , but the movie doesn't do a very good job conveying the issue at hand . 
+1 a film that takes you inside the rhythms of its subject : you experience it as you watch . 
-1 shot perhaps 'artistically' with handheld cameras and apparently no movie lights by joaquin baca-asay , the low-budget production swings annoyingly between vertigo and opacity . 
+1 'they' begins and ends with scenes so terrifying i'm still stunned . and i've decided to leave a light on every night from now on . 
+1 allen's funniest and most likeable movie in years . 
+1 a generation x artifact , capturing a brief era of insanity in the sports arena that surely cannot last . 
+1 there is a certain sense of experimentation and improvisation to this film that may not always work , but it is nevertheless compelling . 
+1 throughout , mr . audiard's direction is fluid and quick . 
-1 the production values are up there . the use of cgi and digital ink-and-paint make the thing look really slick . the voices are fine as well . the problem , it is with most of these things , is the script . 
+1  . . . an interesting slice of history . 
-1 ninety minutes of viva castro ! can be as tiresome as 9 seconds of jesse helms' anti- castro rhetoric , which are included
+1 the production has been made with an enormous amount of affection , so we believe these characters love each other . 
+1 easily the most thoughtful fictional examination of the root causes of anti-semitism ever seen on screen . 
-1 showtime isn't particularly assaultive , but it can still make you feel that you never want to see another car chase , explosion or gunfight again . 
+1 a finely tuned mood piece , a model of menacing atmosphere . 
-1 ensemble movies , like soap operas , depend on empathy . if there ain't none , you have a problem . 
-1 liman , of swingers and go , makes his big-budget action film debut something of a clunker as he delivers a long , low-heat chase , interrupted by a middling car chase . 
-1 the slapstick is labored , and the bigger setpieces flat . 
+1 heaven is a haunting dramatization of a couple's moral ascension . 
+1 same song , second verse , coulda been better , but it coulda been worse . 
-1 steve oedekerk is , alas , no woody allen . 
+1 smart and alert , thirteen conversations about one thing is a small gem . 
-1 it's difficult to imagine that a more confused , less interesting and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 2002 . 
+1 very well-written and very well-acted . 
+1 one of the most slyly exquisite anti-adult movies ever made . 
+1 unfolds in a low-key , organic way that encourages you to accept it as life and go with its flow . 
-1 what's the most positive thing that can be said about the new rob schneider vehicle ? well , it's not as pathetic as the animal . 
+1 intensely romantic , thought-provoking and even an engaging mystery . 
-1 shouldn't have been allowed to use the word " new " in its title , because there's not an original character , siuation or joke in the entire movie . 
-1 the animation and backdrops are lush and inventive , yet return to neverland never manages to take us to that elusive , lovely place where we suspend our disbelief . 
-1 the problem with antwone fisher is that it has a screenplay written by antwone fisher based on the book by antwone fisher . 
+1 this story still seems timely and important . and there's an element of heartbreak to watching it now , with older and wiser eyes , because we know what will happen after greene's story ends . 
+1 an incendiary , deeply thought-provoking look at one of the most peculiar ( and peculiarly venomous ) bigotries in our increasingly frightening theocracy
-1 there is nothing funny in this every-joke-has- been-told-a- thousand-times- before movie . 
-1 there aren't many laughs in this interesting study of the cultural mores of georgian jews in tel aviv . 
-1 all these developments and challenges facing santa weigh down the plot so heavily that they drain all the film of its energy and needlessly strain credibility . 
+1 it's the cute frissons of discovery and humor between chaplin and kidman that keep this nicely wound clock not just ticking , but humming . 
+1 there's lots of cool stuff packed into espn's ultimate x . 
+1 light the candles , bring out the cake and don't fret about the calories because there's precious little substance in birthday girl -- it's simply , and surprisingly , a nice , light treat . 
+1 star wars is back in a major way . 
-1 [h]ad i suffered and bled on the hard ground of ia drang , i'd want something a bit more complex than we were soldiers to be remembered by . 
+1 together , miller , kuras and the actresses make personal velocity into an intricate , intimate and intelligent journey . 
+1 a bittersweet film , simple in form but rich with human events . 
+1 likely to expertly drum up repressed teenage memories in any viewer . 
+1 [ " safe conduct " ] is a long movie at 163 minutes but it fills the time with drama , romance , tragedy , bravery , political intrigue , partisans and sabotage . viva le resistance ! 
-1 overly stylized with lots of flash black-&-white freeze frames reminiscent of a pseudo-hip luxury car commercial , ( it's ) at its worst when it's actually inside the ring . 
-1 technically , the film is about as interesting as an insurance commercial . 
+1 the film tunes into a grief that could lead a man across centuries . 
+1 what better message than 'love thyself' could young women of any size receive ? 
+1  . . . a roller-coaster ride of a movie
-1 how anyone over the age of 2 can stomach the touchy-feely message this preachy produce promotes is beyond us . 
-1 been there , done that , liked it much better the first time around - when it was called the professional . 
-1 late marriage's stiffness is unlikely to demonstrate the emotional clout to sweep u . s . viewers off their feet . 
-1 with lines that feel like long soliloquies -- even as they are being framed in conversation -- max is static , stilted . 
-1 if this is satire , it's the smug and self-congratulatory kind that lets the audience completely off the hook . 
-1 if the tuxedo actually were a suit , it would fit chan like a $99 bargain-basement special . 
+1 australian actor/director john polson and award-winning english cinematographer giles nuttgens make a terrific effort at disguising the obvious with energy and innovation . 
+1 may be the most undeserving victim of critical overkill since town and country . 
+1 nicholson's understated performance is wonderful . as warren he stumbles in search of all the emotions and life experiences he's neglected over the years . 
-1 the movie is so thoughtlessly assembled . 
-1 director jay russell weighs down his capricious fairy-tale with heavy sentiment and lightweight meaning . 
-1 adults , other than the parents . . . will be hard pressed to succumb to the call of the wild . 
+1 this film is an act of spiritual faith -- an eloquent , deeply felt meditation on the nature of compassion . 
+1  . . . planos fijos , tomas largas , un ritmo pausado y una sutil observación de sus personajes , sin estridencias ni grandes revelaciones . 
-1 a low-rent retread of the alien pictures . 
-1 when it's all wet , blue crush is highly enjoyable . when it's on dry land , though , this surfer-girl melodrama starts gasping like a beached grouper . 
+1 there is greatness here . 
+1 both exuberantly romantic and serenely melancholy , what time is it there ? may prove to be [tsai's] masterpiece . 
-1 it's as if a bored cage spent the duration of the film's shooting schedule waiting to scream : " got aids yet ? " 
-1 there is an almost poignant dimension to the way that every major stunt seagal's character . . . performs is shot from behind , as if it could fool us into thinking that we're not watching a double . 
-1 this movie . . . doesn't deserve the energy it takes to describe how bad it is . 
-1 ah , the travails of metropolitan life ! alas , another breathless movie about same ! 
-1  . . . one big laugh , three or four mild giggles , and a whole lot of not much else . 
-1 by the final whistle you're convinced that this mean machine was a decent tv outing that just doesn't have big screen magic . 
+1  " catch me " feels capable of charming the masses with star power , a pop-induced score and sentimental moments that have become a spielberg trademark . 
+1 its maker , steven spielberg , hasn't had so much fun in two decades , since he was schlepping indiana jones around the globe in search of a giant misplaced ashtray . 
-1 in the end , there isn't much to it . 
-1 aggressive self-glorification and a manipulative whitewash . stay for the credits and see a devastating comic impersonation by dustin hoffman that is revelatory . 
-1 the whole affair is as predictable as can be . 
-1 it tries too hard , and overreaches the logic of its own world . 
+1 [it] has the feel of a summer popcorn movie . nothing too deep or substantial . explosions , jokes , and sexual innuendoes abound . 
-1 the author's devotees will probably find it fascinating ; others may find it baffling . 
-1 all the amped-up tony hawk-style stunts and thrashing rap-metal can't disguise the fact that , really , we've been here , done that . 
-1 it's a trifle of a movie , with a few laughs surrounding an unremarkable soft center . 
+1 has a shambling charm . . . a cheerfully inconsequential diversion . 
-1 cinematic pyrotechnics aside , the only thing avary seems to care about are mean giggles and pulchritude . it makes sense that he went back to school to check out the girls -- his film is a frat boy's idea of a good time . 
-1 what was subtle and mystifying in the novella is now broad and farcical . 
-1 to call the other side of heaven " appalling " would be to underestimate just how dangerous entertainments like it can be . 
+1 merely as a technical , logistical feat , russian ark marks a cinematic milestone . 
+1 michael moore has perfected the art of highly entertaining , self-aggrandizing , politically motivated documentary-making , and he's got as potent a topic as ever here . 
-1 staggeringly dreadful romance . 
+1 more than simply a portrait of early extreme sports , this peek into the 1970s skateboard revolution is a skateboard film as social anthropology . . . 
+1 even during the climactic hourlong cricket match , boredom never takes hold . 
+1 vividly conveys the shadow side of the 30-year friendship between two english women . 
-1 supposedly , pokemon can't be killed , but pokemon 4ever practically assures that the pocket monster movie franchise is nearly ready to keel over . 
-1 a terrible movie that some people will nevertheless find moving . 
+1 lavishly , exhilaratingly tasteless . 
+1 if your taste runs to 'difficult' films you absolutely can't miss it . 
+1 weighty and ponderous but every bit as filling as the treat of the title . 
+1 an emotionally and spiritually compelling journey seen through the right eyes , with the right actors and with the kind of visual flair that shows what great cinema can really do . 
-1 the affectionate loopiness that once seemed congenital to demme's perspective has a tough time emerging from between the badly dated cutesy-pie mystery scenario and the newfangled hollywood post-production effects . 
-1 it's so full of wrong choices that all you can do is shake your head in disbelief -- and worry about what classic oliver parker intends to mangle next time . 
+1 one of the most gloriously unsubtle and adrenalized extreme shockers since the evil dead . 
+1 day is not a great bond movie , but it is a good bond movie , which still makes it much better than your typical bond knock-offs . 
-1 movies like this are selling the old european candor , the old wink of 'bold' revelation . but in 2002 , such revelations wilt . 
-1 an entertainment so in love with its overinflated mythology that it no longer recognizes the needs of moviegoers for real characters and compelling plots . 
+1 delightfully rendered
-1 this is as lax and limp a comedy as i've seen in a while , a meander through worn-out material . 
+1 terrific performances , great to look at , and funny . a little uneven to be the cat's meow , but it's good enough to be the purr . 
-1 minority report is exactly what the title indicates , a report . 
-1 imagine kevin smith , the blasphemous bad boy of suburban jersey , if he were stripped of most of his budget and all of his sense of humor . the result might look like vulgar . 
-1 enigma looks great , has solid acting and a neat premise . yet why it fails is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma . 
+1 it's a refreshing change from the self-interest and paranoia that shape most american representations of castro . 
+1 it's that rare family movie -- genuine and sweet without relying on animation or dumb humor . 
-1 a dreary indulgence . 
+1 there are a couple of things that elevate " glory " above most of its ilk , most notably the mere presence of duvall . 
+1 this examination of aquatic life off the shores of the baja california peninsula of mexico offers an engrossing way to demonstrate the virtues of the imax format . 
-1 as an entertainment destination for the general public , kung pow sets a new benchmark for lameness . 
+1 whether or not ram dass proves as clear and reliable an authority on that as he was about inner consciousness , fierce grace reassures us that he will once again be an honest and loving one . 
-1 holland lets things peter out midway , but it's notably better acted -- and far less crass - than some other recent efforts in the burgeoning genre of films about black urban professionals . 
-1 while easier to sit through than most of jaglom's self-conscious and gratingly irritating films , it's still tainted by cliches , painful improbability and murky points . 
-1 a perfectly acceptable , perfectly bland , competently acted but by no means scary horror movie . 
+1 you just know something terrible is going to happen . but when it does , you're entirely unprepared . 
+1 a genuinely moving and wisely unsentimental drama . 
-1 one of those films where the characters inhabit that special annex of hell where adults behave like kids , children behave like adults and everyone screams at the top of their lungs no matter what the situation . 
+1 this movie got me grinning . there's a part of us that cannot help be entertained by the sight of someone getting away with something . 
-1 imagine the cleanflicks version of 'love story , ' with ali macgraw's profanities replaced by romance-novel platitudes . 
-1 an achingly enthralling premise , the film is hindered by uneven dialogue and plot lapses . 
+1 hoffman's performance is authentic to the core of his being . 
+1 this tenth feature is a big deal , indeed -- at least the third-best , and maybe even a notch above the previous runner-up , nicholas meyer's star trek vi : the undiscovered country . 
+1 oddly , the film isn't nearly as downbeat as it sounds , but strikes a tone that's alternately melancholic , hopeful and strangely funny . 
+1 though jackson doesn't always succeed in integrating the characters in the foreground into the extraordinarily rich landscape , it must be said that he is an imaginative filmmaker who can see the forest for the trees . 
+1 young hanks and fisk , who vaguely resemble their celebrity parents , bring fresh good looks and an ease in front of the camera to the work . 
+1 it's a diverting enough hour-and-a-half for the family audience . 
-1 in addition to the overcooked , ham-fisted direction , which has all the actors reaching for the back row , the dialogue sounds like horrible poetry . 
-1 plays like john le carré with a couple of burnt-out cylinders . 
+1 what's so fun about this silly , outrageous , ingenious thriller is the director's talent . watching a brian depalma movie is like watching an alfred hitchcock movie after drinking twelve beers . 
+1 as an entertainment , the movie keeps you diverted and best of all , it lightens your wallet without leaving a sting . 
+1 efficient , suitably anonymous chiller . 
-1 the most remarkable ( and frustrating ) thing about world traveler , which opens today in manhattan , is that its protagonist , after being an object of intense scrutiny for 104 minutes , remains a complete blank . 
-1 while the transgressive trappings ( especially the frank sex scenes ) ensure that the film is never dull , rodrigues's beast-within metaphor is ultimately rather silly and overwrought , making the ambiguous ending seem goofy rather than provocative . 
+1 it's as raw and action-packed an experience as a ringside seat at a tough-man contest . 
+1 sitting in the third row of the imax cinema at sydney's darling harbour , but i sometimes felt as though i was in the tiny two seater plane that carried the giant camera around australia , sweeping and gliding , banking and hovering over some of the most not
-1 ends up being mostly about ravishing costumes , eye-filling , wide-screen production design and joan's wacky decision to stand by her man , no matter how many times he demonstrates that he's a disloyal satyr . 
-1 the plan to make enough into an inspiring tale of survival wrapped in the heart-pounding suspense of a stylish psychological thriller' has flopped as surely as a soufflé gone wrong . 
+1  ( wendigo is ) why we go to the cinema : to be fed through the eye , the heart , the mind . 
+1 the film is exhilarating to watch because sandler , liberated from the constraints of formula , reveals unexpected depths as an actor . 
+1 a great cast and a wonderful but sometimes confusing flashback movie about growing up in a dysfunctional family . 
+1 sayles has an eye for the ways people of different ethnicities talk to and about others outside the group . 
-1 city by the sea is a gritty police thriller with all the dysfunctional family dynamics one could wish for . but how it washed out despite all of that is the project's prime mystery . 
+1 any movie that makes hard work seem heroic deserves a look . 
+1 changing lanes is an anomaly for a hollywood movie ; it's a well-written and occasionally challenging social drama that actually has something interesting to say . 
-1 holds limited appeal to those who like explosions , sadism and seeing people beat each other to a pulp . 
-1 has all the scenic appeal of a cesspool . 
-1 this film's relationship to actual tension is the same as what christmas-tree flocking in a spray can is to actual snow : a poor -- if durable -- imitation . 
+1 the usual movie rah-rah , pleasantly and predictably delivered in low-key style by director michael apted and writer tom stoppard . 
-1 it's as if you're watching a movie that was made in 1978 but not released then because it was so weak , and it has been unearthed and released now , when it has become even weaker . 
-1 forages for audience sympathy like a temperamental child begging for attention , giving audiences no reason to truly care for its decrepit freaks beyond the promise of a reprieve from their incessant whining . 
-1 it's difficult to imagine the process that produced such a script , but here's guessing that spray cheese and underarm noises played a crucial role . 
-1 the most surprising thing about this film is that they are actually releasing it into theaters . 
+1 the movie is well done , but slow . 
-1 there's little to recommend snow dogs , unless one considers cliched dialogue and perverse escapism a source of high hilarity . 
-1 caso você sinta necessidade de sair da sala antes do término da projeção , não se preocupe : ninguém lhe enviará penas simbolizando covardia . 
-1 feels as if the inmates have actually taken over the asylum . 
-1 this is a train wreck of an action film -- a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to force-feed james bond into the mindless xxx mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs . 
+1 one of those rare films that come by once in a while with flawless amounts of acting , direction , story and pace . 
+1 a historical epic with the courage of its convictions about both scope and detail . 
-1 a sterling film - a cross between boys don't cry , deliverance , and ode to billy joe - lies somewhere in the story of matthew shepard , but that film is yet to be made . 
-1 this film is so slick , superficial and trend-hoppy , that it's easy to imagine that a new software program spit out the screenplay . 
-1 for a film about two mismatched buddies , crystal and de niro share little screen time and even less chemistry . 
+1 a bonanza of wacky sight gags , outlandish color schemes , and corny visual puns that can be appreciated equally as an abstract frank tashlin comedy and as a playful recapitulation of the artist's career . 
-1 an ambitious , serious film that manages to do virtually everything wrong ; sitting through it is something akin to an act of cinematic penance . 
+1 the movie's seams may show . . . but pellington gives " mothman " an irresistibly uncanny ambience that goes a long way toward keeping the picture compelling . 
+1 in addition to scoring high for originality of plot -- putting together familiar themes of family , forgiveness and love in a new way -- lilo & stitch has a number of other assets to commend it to movie audiences both innocent and jaded . 
+1 chicago pode até ser um filme divertido e cativante ( como é ) , mas acaba representando um passo que vai na direção contrária à evolução dos musicais . 
-1 rice is too pedestrian a filmmaker to bring any edge or personality to the rising place that would set it apart from other deep south stories . 
+1 for those who like quirky , slightly strange french films , this is a must ! 
+1 from its invitingly upbeat overture to its pathos-filled but ultimately life-affirming finale , martin is a masterfully conducted work . 
-1 most of the characters come off as pantomimesque sterotypes . 
-1 wobbly senegalese updating of " carmen " which is best for the stunning star turn by djeinaba diop gai
+1 a stylistic romp that's always fun to watch . 
-1 apparently writer-director attal thought he need only cast himself and his movie-star wife sitting around in their drawers to justify a film . 
+1 hardly a masterpiece , but it introduces viewers to a good charitable enterprise and some interesting real people . 
-1 what begins as a seemingly brainless , bubbly romantic comedy becomes a cliche-drenched melodrama by mid-film and , by film's end , a feminist action fantasy . 
-1 the plot is very clever , but boyd weighs it down with too many characters and events , all intertwined and far too complicated to keep track of . 
+1 a sun-drenched masterpiece , part parlor game , part psychological case study , part droll social satire . 
+1 the powers team has fashioned a comedy with more laughs than many , no question . but this time there's some mold on the gold . 
-1 morrissette's script and direction show a fair amount of intelligence and wit -- but it doesn't signify a whole lot either . 
+1 'estupendamente actuada , sumamente emotiva y profundamente humana , es una experiencia fílmica imposible de olvidar'
-1 by turns pretentious , fascinating , ludicrous , provocative and vainglorious . 
+1 the climactic events are so well realized that you may forget all about the original conflict , just like the movie does
+1 a comedy-drama of nearly epic proportions rooted in a sincere performance by the title character undergoing midlife crisis . 
+1 those of you who don't believe in santa claus probably also think that sequels can never capture the magic of the original . well , this movie proves you wrong on both counts . 
-1 bad beyond belief and ridiculous beyond description . 
-1 ultimately , jane learns her place as a girl , softens up and loses some of the intensity that made her an interesting character to begin with . 
-1 seagal is painfully foolish in trying to hold onto what's left of his passe' chopsocky glory . 
+1 the film feels uncomfortably real , its language and locations bearing the unmistakable stamp of authority . 
+1 a must-see for fans of thoughtful war films and those interested in the sights and sounds of battle . 
-1 if you're not a prepubescent girl , you'll be laughing at britney spears' movie-starring debut whenever it doesn't have you impatiently squinting at your watch . 
+1 audiard successfully maintains suspense on different levels throughout a film that is both gripping and compelling . 
+1 there is simply no doubt that this film asks the right questions at the right time in the history of our country . 
+1 uneven , self-conscious but often hilarious spoof . 
-1 what you end up getting is the vertical limit of surfing movies - memorable stunts with lots of downtime in between . 
+1 the closest thing to the experience of space travel
-1 77 minutes of pokemon may not last 4ever , it just seems like it does . my only wish is that celebi could take me back to a time before i saw this movie and i could just skip it . 
+1 far more successful , if considerably less ambitious , than last year's kubrick-meets-spielberg exercise . 
+1 i'm going to give it a marginal thumbs up . i liked it just enough . 
+1  . . . a magnificent drama well worth tracking down . 
-1 the editing is chaotic , the photography grainy and badly focused , the writing unintentionally hilarious , the direction unfocused , the performances as wooden . 
+1 more honest about alzheimer's disease , i think , than iris . 
+1 the large-format film is well suited to capture these musicians in full regalia and the incredible imax sound system lets you feel the beat down to your toes . 
-1 [a] poorly executed comedy . 
-1 better to just call it abc kiarostami . for aids and africa are nothing more than part of the scenery . 
+1 mr . deeds is , as comedy goes , very silly -- and in the best way . 
-1 with danilo donati's witty designs and dante spinotti's luscious cinematography , this might have made a decent children's movie -- if only benigni hadn't insisted on casting himself in the title role . 
-1 it all feels like a monty python sketch gone horribly wrong . 
-1 this slender plot feels especially thin stretched over the nearly 80-minute running time . 
-1 once again , the intelligence of gay audiences has been grossly underestimated , and a meaty plot and well-developed characters have been sacrificed for skin and flash that barely fizzle . 
-1 no aspirations to social import inform the movie version . this is a shameless sham , calculated to cash in on the popularity of its stars . 
-1 it follows the basic plot trajectory of nearly every schwarzenegger film : someone crosses arnie . arnie blows things up . 
-1 malone does have a gift for generating nightmarish images that will be hard to burn out of your brain . but the movie's narrative hook is way too muddled to be an effectively chilling guilty pleasure . 
-1 barely goes beyond comic book status . 
-1 i wish i could say " thank god it's friday " , but the truth of the matter is i was glad when it was over . 
-1 'dragonfly' dwells on crossing-over mumbo jumbo , manipulative sentimentality , and sappy dialogue . 
-1 a light , engaging comedy that fumbles away almost all of its accumulated enjoyment with a crucial third act miscalculation . 
-1 it's hard to imagine that even very small children will be impressed by this tired retread . 
-1 the darker elements of misogyny and unprovoked violence suffocate the illumination created by the two daughters and the sparse instances of humor meant to shine through the gloomy film noir veil . 
+1 as averse as i usually am to feel-good , follow-your-dream hollywood fantasies , this one got to me . 
+1 a film that is a portrait of grace in an imperfect world . 
-1 it's leaden and predictable , and laughs are lacking . 
+1 third time's the charm . . . yeah , baby ! 
-1 as is often the case with ambitious , eager first-time filmmakers , mr . murray , a prolific director of music videos , stuffs his debut with more plot than it can comfortably hold . 
-1 undercover brother doesn't go far enough . it's just a silly black genre spoof . 
-1 looks and feels like a low-budget hybrid of scarface or carlito's way . 
+1 at its best early on as it plays the culture clashes between the brothers . 
+1 this film is not a love letter for the slain rappers , it's a taunt -a call for justice for two crimes from which many of us have not yet recovered . 
-1 even after 90 minutes of playing opposite each other bullock and grant still look ill at ease sharing the same scene . what should have been a painless time-killer becomes instead a grating endurance test . 
-1 a fake street drama that keeps telling you things instead of showing them . 
+1 the film is about the relationships rather than about the outcome . and it sees those relationships , including that between the son and his wife , and the wife and the father , and between the two brothers , with incredible subtlety and acumen . 
-1 the movie eventually snaps under the strain of its plot contrivances and its need to reassure . 
+1 complex , affecting and uniquely almodóvar , the film evokes strong emotions and pushes viewers to question their deepest notions of moral right and wrong . 
-1 to the vast majority of more casual filmgoers , it will probably be a talky bore . 
+1 [majidi] makes us think twice about immigrants we see around us every day . 
-1 elmo touts his drug as being 51 times stronger than coke . if you're looking for a tale of brits behaving badly , watch snatch again . it's 51 times better than this . 
-1 handled correctly , wilde's play is a masterpiece of elegant wit and artifice . here , alas , it collapses like an overcooked soufflé . 
+1 it's like going to a house party and watching the host defend himself against a frothing ex-girlfriend . you don't want to call the cops . you want to call domino's . 
+1 the tone is balanced , reflective and reasonable . 
-1 a timid , soggy near miss . 
+1 this cheery , down-to-earth film is warm with the cozy feeling of relaxing around old friends . 
+1 a lovely film . . . elegant , witty and beneath a prim exterior unabashedly romantic . . . hugely enjoyable in its own right though not really faithful to its source's complexity . 
-1 a sham construct based on theory , sleight-of-hand , and ill-wrought hypothesis . 
+1 continually challenges perceptions of guilt and innocence , of good guys and bad , and asks us whether a noble end can justify evil means . 
+1 a devastating indictment of unbridled greed and materalism . 
-1 prurient playthings aside , there's little to love about this english trifle . 
-1 with this new rollerball , sense and sensibility have been overrun by what can only be characterized as robotic sentiment . 
+1 try as you might to resist , if you've got a place in your heart for smokey robinson , this movie will worm its way there . 
-1 in the new guy , even the bull gets recycled . 
+1 a memorable experience that , like many of his works , presents weighty issues colorfully wrapped up in his own idiosyncratic strain of kitschy goodwill . 
-1 like so many other allegedly scary movies , it gets so tangled up in the twist that it chokes the energy right out of the very audience it seeks to frighten . 
+1 sharp , lively , funny and ultimately sobering film . 
+1 don't expect any surprises in this checklist of teamwork cliches . . . 
+1 showtime is a fine-looking film with a bouncy score and a clutch of lively songs for deft punctuation . 
+1 open-ended and composed of layer upon layer , talk to her is a cinephile's feast , an invitation to countless interpretations . 
-1 heavy with flabby rolls of typical toback machinations . 
+1 so original in its base concept that you cannot help but get caught up . 
-1 this strenuously unfunny showtime deserves the hook . 
+1 now trimmed by about 20 minutes , this lavish three-year-old production has enough grandeur and scale to satisfy as grown-up escapism . 
-1 rumor , a muddled drama about coming to terms with death , feels impersonal , almost generic . 
+1 it's mostly a pleasure to watch . and the reason for that is a self-aware , often self-mocking , intelligence . 
-1 this is a picture that maik , the firebrand turned savvy ad man , would be envious of : it hijacks the heat of revolution and turns it into a sales tool . 
-1 director elie chouraqui , who co-wrote the script , catches the chaotic horror of war , but why bother if you're going to subjugate truth to the tear-jerking demands of soap opera ? 
-1 tiresomely derivative and hammily acted . 
-1 when in doubt , the film ratchets up the stirring soundtrack , throws in a fish-out-of-water gag and lets the cliched dialogue rip . or else a doggie winks . 
-1 it's a bad sign in a thriller when you instantly know whodunit . 
+1 occasionally funny , always very colorful and enjoyably overblown in the traditional almodóvar style . 
+1 if " lilo & stitch " isn't the most edgy piece of disney animation to hit the silver screen , then this first film to use a watercolor background since " dumbo " certainly ranks as the most original in years . 
-1 falsehoods pile up , undermining the movie's reality and stifling its creator's comic voice . 
+1 the film is a verbal duel between two gifted performers . 
+1 the low-key direction is pleasingly emphatic in this properly intense , claustrophobic tale of obsessive love . 
-1 master of disguise runs for only 71 minutes and feels like three hours . 
+1 reveals how important our special talents can be when put in service of of others . it also shows how deeply felt emotions can draw people together across the walls that might otherwise separate them . 
-1 it's an awfully derivative story . 
+1 a cartoon that's truly cinematic in scope , and a story that's compelling and heartfelt -- even if the heart belongs to a big , four-legged herbivore . 
-1 i didn't find much fascination in the swinging . what they're doing is a matter of plumbing arrangements and mind games , of no erotic or sensuous charge . but that they are doing it is thought-provoking . 
-1 you may be galled that you've wasted nearly two hours of your own precious life with this silly little puddle of a movie . 
-1 with more character development this might have been an eerie thriller ; with better payoffs , it could have been a thinking man's monster movie . 
+1 will amuse and provoke adventurous adults in specialty venues . 
+1 pacino and williams seem to keep upping the ante on each other , just as their characters do in the film . what results is the best performance from either in years . 
-1 the animation and game phenomenon that peaked about three years ago is actually dying a slow death , if the poor quality of pokemon 4 ever is any indication . 
-1 told in scattered fashion , the movie only intermittently lives up to the stories and faces and music of the men who are its subject . 
-1 benigni's pinocchio is extremely straight and mind-numbingly stilted , its episodic pacing keeping the film from developing any storytelling flow . 
+1 the film is enriched by an imaginatively mixed cast of antic spirits , headed by christopher plummer as the subtlest and most complexly evil uncle ralph i've ever seen in the many film and stage adaptations of the work . 
+1 the whole is quite entertaining , but despite its virtues , there is an unsettled feeling to the film . 
-1 fans of the tv series will be disappointed , and everyone else will be slightly bored . 
-1 this 10th film in the series looks and feels tired . 
-1 the whole film has this sneaky feel to it  as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as very important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a hollywood product . 
-1 'the château is never quite able to overcome the cultural moat surrounding its ludicrous and contrived plot . '
-1 manages to be both repulsively sadistic and mundane . 
+1 binoche and magimel are perfect in these roles . 
+1 it could change america , not only because it is full of necessary discussion points , but because it is so accessible that it makes complex politics understandable to viewers looking for nothing but energetic entertainment . 
+1 like a precious and finely cut diamond , magnificent to behold in its sparkling beauty yet in reality it's one tough rock . 
-1 if this is the resurrection of the halloween franchise , it would have been better off dead . 
+1 although very much like the first movie based on j . k . rowling's phenomenal fantasy best sellers , this second go-round possesses a quite pleasing , headlong thrust and a likably delinquent attitude . 
-1 the best thing that can be said of the picture is that it does have a few cute moments . 
+1 you may think you have figured out the con and the players in this debut film by argentine director fabian bielinsky , but while you were thinking someone made off with your wallet . 
+1 goyer's screenplay and direction are thankfully understated , and he has drawn excellent performances from his cast . 
+1 another love story in 2002's remarkable procession of sweeping pictures that have reinvigorated the romance genre . 
-1 it's rare to see a movie that takes such a speedy swan dive from " promising " to " interesting " to " familiar " before landing squarely on " stupid " . 
+1 an enormously entertaining movie , like nothing we've ever seen before , and yet completely familiar . 
+1 hard , endearing , caring , warm . bring tissues . 
-1 i'd give real money to see the perpetrators of chicago torn apart by dingoes . 
+1 an energizing , intoxicating documentary charting the rise of hip-hop culture in general and the art of scratching ( or turntablism ) in particular . 
-1 painfully padded . 
-1 any attempts at nuance given by the capable cast is drowned out by director jon purdy's sledgehammer sap . 
-1 an intriguing near-miss . 
+1 the story has some nice twists but the ending and some of the back-story is a little tired . the performances are all solid ; it merely lacks originality to make it a great movie . 
-1 such a wildly uneven hit-and-miss enterprise , you can't help suspecting that it was improvised on a day-to-day basis during production . 
+1 insomnia loses points when it surrenders to a formulaic bang-bang , shoot-em-up scene at the conclusion . but the performances of pacino , williams , and swank keep the viewer wide-awake all the way through . 
-1 no amount of burning , blasting , stabbing , and shooting can hide a weak script . 
-1 if i could have looked into my future and saw how bad this movie was , i would go back and choose to skip it . fortunately , you still have that option . 
-1 holden caulfield did it better . 
-1 the backyard battles you staged with your green plastic army men were more exciting and almost certainly made more sense . 
+1 a conventional , but well-crafted film about a historic legal battle in ireland over a man's right to raise his own children . 
-1 mattei so completely loses himself to the film's circular structure to ever offer any insightful discourse on , well , love in the time of money . 
-1 this is a movie where the most notable observation is how long you've been sitting still . 
+1 a quirky comedy set in newfoundland that cleverly captures the dry wit that's so prevalent on the rock . 
-1 despite the pyrotechnics , narc is strictly by the book . 
+1 some actors have so much charisma that you'd be happy to listen to them reading the phone book . hugh grant and sandra bullock are two such likeable actors . 
-1 a great script brought down by lousy direction . same guy with both hats . big mistake . 
+1 zhang . . . has done an amazing job of getting realistic performances from his mainly nonprofessional cast . 
+1 liotta put on 30 pounds for the role , and has completely transformed himself from his smooth , goodfellas image . 
+1 though the story . . . is hackneyed , the characters have a freshness and modesty that transcends their predicament . 
-1 rock's stand-up magic wanes . hopkins , squarely fills the screen . action - mechanical . 
+1 the journey is worth your time , especially if you have ellen pompeo sitting next to you for the ride . 
-1 [n]o matter how much good will the actors generate , showtime eventually folds under its own thinness . 
-1  . . . unlike [scorsese's mean streets] , ash wednesday is essentially devoid of interesting characters or even a halfway intriguing plot . 
+1 the unexplored story opportunities of " punch-drunk love " may have worked against the maker's minimalist intent but it is an interesting exercise by talented writer/director anderson . 
+1 it's a minor comedy that tries to balance sweetness with coarseness , while it paints a sad picture of the singles scene . 
-1 it will come as no surprise that the movie isn't scary . but here's the real damn : it isn't funny , either . 
+1 one of those movies that catches you up in something bigger than yourself , namely , an archetypal desire to enjoy good trash every now and then . 
+1 a solidly entertaining little film . 
-1 instead of contriving a climactic hero's death for the beloved-major- character-who-shall- remain-nameless , why not invite some genuine spontaneity into the film by having the evil aliens' laser guns actually hit something for once ? 
-1 an inconsequential , barely there bit of piffle . 
+1 greengrass has delivered an undoubted stylistic tour-de-force , and has managed elements such as sound and cinematography with skill
-1 a complete waste of time . 
+1 a jewish ww ii doc that isn't trying simply to out-shock , out-outrage or out-depress its potential audience ! who knew . . . 
+1 cantet perfectly captures the hotel lobbies , two-lane highways , and roadside cafes that permeate vincent's days
-1 acting , particularly by tambor , almost makes " never again " worthwhile , but [writer/director] schaeffer should follow his titular advice
-1 once [kim] begins to overplay the shock tactics and bait-and-tackle metaphors , you may decide it's too high a price to pay for a shimmering picture postcard . 
-1 the movie weighs no more than a glass of flat champagne . 
+1 i've never bought from telemarketers , but i bought this movie . 
-1 feels shrill , simple and soapy . 
+1 the performances are uniformly good . 
-1 the christ allegory doesn't work because there is no foundation for it
-1 the film ultimately offers nothing more than people in an urban jungle needing other people to survive . . . 
-1 theology aside , why put someone who ultimately doesn't learn at the center of a kids' story ? 
-1 it's inoffensive , cheerful , built to inspire the young people , set to an unending soundtrack of beach party pop numbers and aside from its remarkable camerawork and awesome scenery , it's about as exciting as a sunburn . 
-1 lillard and cardellini earn their scooby snacks , but not anyone else . 
+1 a stylish cast and some clever scripting solutions help chicago make the transition from stage to screen with considerable appeal intact . 
+1 a charming but slight comedy . 
+1 as a director , mr . ratliff wisely rejects the temptation to make fun of his subjects . 
-1 this is a particularly toxic little bonbon , palatable to only a chosen and very jaundiced few . 
+1 like edward norton in american history x , ryan gosling ( murder by numbers ) delivers a magnetic performance . 
+1 campanella gets the tone just right -- funny in the middle of sad in the middle of hopeful . 
-1 distances you by throwing out so many red herrings , so many false scares , that the genuine ones barely register . 
-1 most of the supporting characters in eastwood films are weak , as are most of the subplots . this one's weaker than most . 
+1 a tone poem of transgression . 
+1 whenever it threatens to get bogged down in earnest dramaturgy , a stirring visual sequence like a surge through swirling rapids or a leap from pinnacle to pinnacle rouses us . if horses could fly , this is surely what they'd look like . 
-1 obvious , obnoxious and didactic burlesque . 
+1 while locals will get a kick out of spotting cleveland sites , the rest of the world will enjoy a fast-paced comedy with quirks that might make the award-winning coen brothers envious . 
-1 humor in i spy is so anemic . 
+1 raimi and his team couldn't have done any better in bringing the story of spider-man to the big screen . 
-1 an exhausting family drama about a porcelain empire and just as hard a flick as its subject matter . 
-1 this ill-conceived and expensive project winds up looking like a bunch of talented thesps slumming it . 
-1 absolutely ( and unintentionally ) terrifying . 
-1 peralta's mythmaking could have used some informed , adult hindsight . 
+1 perhaps not since nelson eddy crooned his indian love call to jeanette macdonald has there been a movie so unabashedly canadian , not afraid to risk american scorn or disinterest . 
+1 a literary detective story is still a detective story and aficionados of the whodunit won't be disappointed . 
-1 murder and mayhem of this sort quickly becomes monotonous . 
-1 a noble failure . 
-1 dense and enigmatic . . . elusive . . . stagy and stilted
-1 lazily directed by charles stone iii . . . from a leaden script by matthew cirulnick and novelist thulani davis . 
-1 you'll just have your head in your hands wondering why lee's character didn't just go to a bank manager and save everyone the misery . 
+1 although fairly involving as far as it goes , the film doesn't end up having much that is fresh to say about growing up catholic or , really , anything . 
-1 there's a bit of thematic meat on the bones of queen of the damned , as its origins in an anne rice novel dictate , but generally , it's a movie that emphasizes style over character and substance . 
-1 i was sent a copyof this film to review on dvd . for free . i still want my money back . 
+1 a diverse and astonishingly articulate cast of palestinian and israeli children . 
-1 for all its alleged youthful fire , xxx is no less subservient to bond's tired formula of guns , girls and gadgets while brandishing a new action hero . 
-1 despite juliet stevenon's attempt to bring cohesion to pamela's emotional roller coaster life , it is not enough to give the film the substance it so desperately needs . 
+1 an infectious cultural fable with a tasty balance of family drama and frenetic comedy . 
+1 a potent allegorical love story . 
+1 it takes this never-ending confusion and hatred , puts a human face on it , evokes shame among all who are party to it and even promotes understanding . 
+1 schrader examines crane's decline with unblinking candor . 
+1 a disturbing and frighteningly evocative assembly of imagery and hypnotic music composed by philip glass .

+1 although some viewers will not be able to stomach so much tongue-in-cheek weirdness , those who do will have found a cult favorite to enjoy for a lifetime . 
+1 like the chilled breath of oral storytelling frozen onto film . 
-1 we have poignancy jostling against farce , thoughtful dialogue elbowed aside by one-liners , and a visual style that incorporates rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except , maybe , that it looks neat . 
+1 this cuddly sequel to the 1999 hit is a little more visually polished , a little funnier , and a little more madcap . 
-1 the script by vincent r . nebrida . . . tries to cram too many ingredients into one small pot . 
+1 you walk out of the good girl with mixed emotions  disapproval of justine combined with a tinge of understanding for her actions . 
+1 as they used to say in the 1950s sci-fi movies , signs is a tribute to shyamalan's gifts , which are such that we'll keep watching the skies for his next project . 
+1 manages to be wholesome and subversive at the same time . 
-1 off the hook is overlong and not well-acted , but credit writer-producer-director adam watstein with finishing it at all . 
-1 no surprises . 
-1 lawrence should stick to his day job . he's a better actor than a standup comedian . 
+1 perhaps the best sports movie i've ever seen . 
-1 we're left with a story that tries to grab us , only to keep letting go at all the wrong moments . 
+1 there's an energy to y tu mamá también . much of it comes from the brave , uninhibited performances by its lead actors . 
+1 a visionary marvel , but it's lacking a depth in storytelling usually found in anime like this . 
+1 this is a story that zings all the way through with originality , humour and pathos . 
+1 no wonder they're talking about " talk to her . " it's astonishing . 
+1 its gentle , touching story creeps into your heart . 
+1 at once a testament to the divine calling of education and a demonstration of the painstaking process of imparting knowledge . 
-1 the whole affair , true story or not , feels incredibly hokey . . . [it] comes off like a hallmark commercial . 
-1  . . . del toro maintains a dark mood that makes the film seem like something to endure instead of enjoy . 
+1 a well-executed spy-thriller . 
-1 this sade is hardly a perverse , dangerous libertine and agitator -- which would have made for better drama . he's just a sad aristocrat in tattered finery , and the film seems as deflated as he does . 
-1 paxton's uneven directorial debut fails to unlock the full potential of what is in many ways a fresh and dramatically substantial spin on the genre . 
-1 kurys seems intimidated by both her subject matter and the period trappings of this debut venture into the heritage business . 
+1 never once predictable . 
-1 lacking gravitas , macdowell is a placeholder for grief , and ergo this sloppy drama is an empty vessel . leave these flowers unpicked -- they're dead on the vine . 
-1 a particularly joyless , and exceedingly dull , period coming-of-age tale . 
-1 no , i don't know why steven seagal is considered a star , nor why he keeps being cast in action films when none of them are ever any good or make any money . 
+1 jones has delivered a solidly entertaining and moving family drama . 
+1 though few will argue that it ranks with the best of herzog's works , invincible shows he's back in form , with an astoundingly rich film . 
-1 this is a fudged opportunity of gigantic proportions -- a lunar mission with no signs of life . 
-1 it's hard to say who might enjoy this , are there tolstoy groupies out there ? it's dark and tragic , and lets the business of the greedy talent agents get in the way of saying something meaningful about facing death
-1 a sour , nasty offering . 
+1 you'll gasp appalled and laugh outraged and possibly , watching the spectacle of a promising young lad treading desperately in a nasty sea , shed an errant tear . 
-1 demeo is not without talent ; he just needs better material .

-1 whenever you think you've seen the end of the movie , we cut to a new scene , which also appears to be the end . but , no , we get another scene , and then another . you begin to long for the end credits as the desert does for rain . 
+1 as the princess , sorvino glides gracefully from male persona to female without missing a beat . ben kingsley is truly funny , playing a kind of ghandi gone bad . 
+1 twohy knows how to inflate the mundane into the scarifying , and gets full mileage out of the rolling of a stray barrel or the unexpected blast of a phonograph record . 
-1  . . . if you , like me , think an action film disguised as a war tribute is disgusting to begin with , then you're in for a painful ride . 
-1 what happens when something goes bump in the night and nobody cares ? 
+1 meyjes . . . has done his homework and soaked up some jazzy new revisionist theories about the origins of nazi politics and aesthetics . 
-1 men in black ii has sequel-itis something fierce . an ungainly , comedy-deficient , b-movie rush job . . . 
+1 seeing seinfeld at home as he watches his own appearance on letterman with a clinical eye reminds you that the key to stand-up is to always make it look easy , even though the reality is anything but . 
-1 the actors are appealing , but elysian fields is idiotic and absurdly sentimental . 
-1 it's mindless junk like this that makes you appreciate original romantic comedies like punch-drunk love . 
+1 while general audiences might not come away with a greater knowledge of the facts of cuban music , they'll be treated to an impressive and highly entertaining celebration of its sounds . 
-1 it's easy to love robin tunney -- she's pretty and she can act -- but it gets harder and harder to understand her choices . 
+1 has it ever been possible to say that williams has truly inhabited a character ? it is now . 
+1 a thriller with an edge -- which is to say that it doesn't follow the stale , standard , connect-the-dots storyline which has become commonplace in movies that explore the seamy underbelly of the criminal world . 
-1 it's difficult to say whether the tuxedo is more boring or embarrassing--i'm prepared to call it a draw . 
-1 in the spirit of the season , i assign one bright shining star to roberto benigni's pinocchio -- but i guarantee that no wise men will be following after it . 
-1 as predictable as the outcome of a globetrotters-generals game , juwanna mann is even more ludicrous than you'd expect from the guy-in-a-dress genre , and a personal low for everyone involved .

-1 the story's pathetic and the gags are puerile . 
+1 though it lacks the utter authority of a genre gem , there's a certain robustness to this engaging mix of love and bloodletting . 
+1 two hours of melodramatic musical married to two hours of underdog sports intrigue , if the picture also shares the weaknesses of both genres , more's the pity . 
-1 cherish is a dud -- a romantic comedy that's not the least bit romantic and only mildly funny . 
+1 a compelling yarn , but not quite a ripping one . 
-1 makes 98 minutes feel like three hours . 
-1 there's not enough to sustain the comedy . 
+1 it is a strength of a documentary to disregard available bias , especially as temptingly easy as it would have been with this premise . 
-1 each scene drags , underscoring the obvious , and sentiment is slathered on top . 
+1 you have to pay attention to follow all the stories , but they're each interesting . the movie is well shot and very tragic , and one to ponder after the credits roll . 
-1 no such thing is sort of a minimalist beauty and the beast , but in this case the beast should definitely get top billing . robert john burke as the monster horns in and steals the show . 
+1 with spy kids 2 : the island of lost dreams , the spy kids franchise establishes itself as a durable part of the movie landscape : a james bond series for kids . 
-1 hollywood ending is the most disappointing woody allen movie ever . he has a great cast and a great idea . but the execution is a flop with the exception of about six gags that really work . 
+1 sweet and memorable film .

-1 sweet home alabama is one dumb movie , but its stupidity is so relentlessly harmless that it almost wins you over in the end . 
+1 fresh and raw like a blown-out vein , narc takes a walking-dead , cop-flick subgenre and beats new life into it . 
-1 the crassness of this reactionary thriller is matched only by the ridiculousness of its premise . 
+1 between them , de niro and murphy make showtime the most savory and hilarious guilty pleasure of many a recent movie season . 
-1 george , hire a real director and good writers for the next installment , please . 
+1 demonstrates the unusual power of thoughtful , subjective filmmaking . 
+1 a heady , biting , be-bop ride through nighttime manhattan , a loquacious videologue of the modern male and the lengths to which he'll go to weave a protective cocoon around his own ego . 
-1 what with the incessant lounge music playing in the film's background , you may mistake love liza for an adam sandler chanukah song . 
-1 to build a feel-good fantasy around a vain dictator-madman is off-putting , to say the least , not to mention inappropriate and wildly undeserved . 
+1 good car chases , great fight scenes , and a distinctive blend of european , american and asian influences . 
+1 simultaneously heartbreakingly beautiful and exquisitely sad . 
-1 while the mystery unravels , the characters respond by hitting on each other . 
-1 if only the story about a multi-million dollar con bothered to include the con . 
-1 well-made but mush-hearted . 
-1 abandon spends 90 minutes trying figure out whether or not some cocky pseudo-intellectual kid has intentionally left college or was killed . the only problem is that , by the end , no one in the audience or the film seems to really care . 
-1 because the intelligence level of the characters must be low , very low , very very low , for the masquerade to work , the movie contains no wit , only labored gags . 
+1 exploits [headbanger] stereotypes in good fun , while adding a bit of heart and unsettling subject matter . 
+1 an incredibly low-rent danish film , it brings a group of people together in a sweet and charming way , if a little convenient
-1 the film would work much better as a video installation in a museum , where viewers would be free to leave . immediately . 
-1 as david letterman and the onion have proven , the worst of tragedies can be fertile sources of humor , but lawrence has only a fleeting grasp of how to develop them . 
+1 a full world has been presented onscreen , not some series of carefully structured plot points building to a pat resolution . 
+1  . . . gripping and handsome execution , ( but ) there isn't much about k-19 that's unique or memorable . 
+1 i'm happy to have seen it -- not as an alternate version , but as the ultimate exercise in viewing deleted scenes . 
-1 a era do gelo diverte , mas não convence . É um passatempo descompromissado  e só . 
+1 more timely than its director could ever have dreamed , this quietly lyrical tale probes the ambiguous welcome extended by iran to the afghani refugees who streamed across its borders , desperate for work and food . 
+1 sometimes charming , sometimes infuriating , this argentinean 'dramedy' succeeds mainly on the shoulders of its actors . 
-1 a lame romantic comedy about an unsympathetic character and someone who would not likely be so stupid as to get involved with her . 
+1 harris commands the screen , using his frailty to suggest the ravages of a life of corruption and ruthlessness . 
-1 irwin and his director never come up with an adequate reason why we should pay money for what we can get on television for free . 
+1 gives us a lot to chew on , but not all of it has been properly digested . 
+1 the powerful success of read my lips with such provocative material shows why , after only three films , director/co-writer jacques audiard , though little known in this country , belongs in the very top rank of french filmmakers . 
-1 nelson's brutally unsentimental approach . . . sucks the humanity from the film , leaving behind an horrific but weirdly unemotional spectacle . 
+1 it's worth seeing just on the basis of the wisdom , and at times , the startling optimism , of the children . 
+1 a frisky and fresh romantic comedy exporing sexual politics and the challenges of friendships between women . 
+1 a chick flick for guys . 
-1 boasting some of the most poorly staged and lit action in memory , impostor is as close as you can get to an imitation movie . 
-1 an occasionally funny , but overall limp , fish-out-of-water story . 
-1 the script has less spice than a rat burger and the rock's fighting skills are more in line with steven seagal . 
+1 by the time we learn that andrew's turnabout is fair play is every bit as awful as borchardt's coven , we can enjoy it anyway . 
+1 uneven but a lot of fun . 
-1 it's not that kung pow isn't funny some of the time -- it just isn't any funnier than bad martial arts movies are all by themselves , without all oedekerk's impish augmentation . 
+1  ( caine ) proves once again he hasn't lost his touch , bringing off a superb performance in an admittedly middling film . 
+1 on the surface a silly comedy , scotland , pa would be forgettable if it weren't such a clever adaptation of the bard's tragic play . 
+1 beresford nicely mixes in as much humor as pathos to take us on his sentimental journey of the heart . it really is a shame that more won't get an opportunity to embrace small , sweet 'evelyn . '
-1 sacrifices the value of its wealth of archival foot-age with its less-than-objective stance . 
-1 desperately unfunny when it tries to makes us laugh and desperately unsuspenseful when it tries to make us jump out of our seats . 
+1 a no-holds-barred cinematic treat . 
+1 informative , intriguing , observant , often touching . . . gives a human face to what's often discussed in purely abstract terms . 
+1 douglas mcgrath's nicholas nickleby does dickens as it should be done cinematically . 
-1 the entire movie is about a boring , sad man being boring and sad . 
-1 labute can't avoid a fatal mistake in the modern era : he's changed the male academic from a lower-class brit to an american , a choice that upsets the novel's exquisite balance and shreds the fabric of the film . 
-1 it might be the first sci-fi comedy that could benefit from a three's company-style laugh track . 
+1 from spiritual rebirth to bruising defeat , vincent's odyssey resonates in a profound way , comparable to the classic films of jean renoir . 
-1 the movie's major and most devastating flaw is its reliance on formula , though , and it's quite enough to lessen the overall impact the movie could have had . 
+1 flawed , but worth seeing for ambrose's performance . 
+1 haneke challenges us to confront the reality of sexual aberration . 
-1 harland williams is so funny in drag he should consider permanent sex-reassignment . 
-1 when the film ended , i felt tired and drained and wanted to lie on my own deathbed for a while . 
-1 [crystal and de niro] manage to squeeze out some good laughs but not enough to make this silly con job sing . 
+1 beautifully crafted , engaging filmmaking that should attract upscale audiences hungry for quality and a nostalgic , twisty yarn that will keep them guessing . 
+1 an intelligent , moving and invigorating film . 
-1  ( it ) highlights not so much the crime lord's messianic bent , but spacey's . 
+1 shattering , devastating documentary on two maladjusted teens in a downward narcotized spiral . extraordinary debut from josh koury . 
+1 on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , the powerpuff girls is a fast , frenetic , funny , even punny 6 -- aimed specifically at a grade-school audience . 
-1 attempts by this ensemble film to impart a message are so heavy-handed that they instead pummel the audience . 
-1 the country bears has no scenes that will upset or frighten young viewers . unfortunately , there is almost nothing in this flat effort that will amuse or entertain them , either . 
-1 there ought to be a directing license , so that ed burns can have his revoked . 
-1 a cross between blow and boyz n the hood , this movie strives to be more , but doesn't quite get there . good performances keep it from being a total rehash . 
+1 a conventional but heartwarming tale . 
-1 a dark comedy that goes for sick and demented humor simply to do so . the movie is without intent . 
-1 i'm not sure which is worse : the poor acting by the ensemble cast , the flat dialogue by vincent r . nebrida or the gutless direction by laurice guillen . 
-1 loud , chaotic and largely unfunny . 
-1 hampered -- no , paralyzed -- by a self-indulgent script . . . that aims for poetry and ends up sounding like satire . 
+1 even if invincible is not quite the career peak that the pianist is for roman polanski , it demonstrates that werner herzog can still leave us with a sense of wonder at the diverse , marvelously twisted shapes history has taken . 
-1 the four feathers is definitely horse feathers , but if you go in knowing that , you might have fun in this cinematic sandbox . 
-1 not exaggerated enough to be a parody of gross-out flicks , college flicks , or even flicks in general . it merely indulges in the worst elements of all of them . 
+1 an intelligent , earnest , intimate film that drops the ball only when it pauses for blunt exposition to make sure you're getting its metaphysical point . 
+1 while the story's undeniably hard to follow , iwai's gorgeous visuals seduce . 
-1 is there a group of more self-absorbed women than the mother and daughters featured in this film ? i don't think so . nothing wrong with performances here , but the whiney characters bugged me . 
-1 the movie's messages are quite admirable , but the story is just too clichéd and too often strains credulity . 
-1 detox is ultimately a pointless endeavor . 
-1 this pathetic junk is barely an hour long . nevertheless , it still seems endless . 
+1 in the long , dishonorable history of quickie teen-pop exploitation , like mike stands out for its only partly synthetic decency . 
+1 brosnan is more feral in this film than i've seen him before and halle berry does her best to keep up with him . 
+1 between the drama of cube ? s personal revelations regarding what the shop means in the big picture , iconic characters gambol fluidly through the story , with charming results . 
+1 in a summer overrun with movies dominated by cgi aliens and super heroes , it revigorates the mind to see a feature that concentrates on people , a project in which the script and characters hold sway . 
-1 this wretchedly unfunny wannabe comedy is inane and awful - no doubt , it's the worst movie i've seen this summer . 
+1 nervy and sensitive , it taps into genuine artistic befuddlement , and at the same time presents a scathing indictment of what drives hollywood . 
-1 it is very difficult to care about the character , and that is the central flaw of the film . 
-1 it's deep-sixed by a compulsion to catalog every bodily fluids gag in there's something about mary and devise a parallel clone-gag . 
+1 an overly melodramatic but somewhat insightful french coming-of-age film . . . 
-1 a bland , obnoxious 88-minute infomercial for universal studios and its ancillary products . 
+1 even if you can't pronounce " gyro " correctly , you'll appreciate much of vardalos' humor , which transcends ethnic boundaries . 
+1 anyone who welcomes a dash of the avant-garde fused with their humor should take pleasure in this crazed , joyous romp of a film . 
+1 you won't have any trouble getting kids to eat up these veggies . 
+1 an elegant film with often surprising twists and an intermingling of naiveté and sophistication . 
+1 the film has several strong performances . 
-1 a movie that hovers somewhere between an acute character study and a trite power struggle . 
-1 unless you're a fanatic , the best advice is : 'scooby' don't . 
-1 in any case , i would recommend big bad love only to winger fans who have missed her since 1995's forget paris . but even then , i'd recommend waiting for dvd and just skipping straight to her scenes . 
-1 the film is grossly contradictory in conveying its social message , if indeed there is one . 
+1 affirms the gifts of all involved , starting with spielberg and going right through the ranks of the players -- on-camera and off -- that he brings together . 
-1 a backhanded ode to female camaraderie penned by a man who has little clue about either the nature of women or of friendship . 
+1 this is a good script , good dialogue , funny even for adults . the characters are interesting and often very creatively constructed from figure to backstory . the film will play equally well on both the standard and giant screens . 
+1 may not be a breakthrough in filmmaking , but it is unwavering and arresting . 
+1 there has been much puzzlement among critics about what the election symbolizes . i believe the message is in the messenger : the agent is a woman . 
-1 the biggest problem with satin rouge is lilia herself . she's a cipher , played by an actress who smiles and frowns but doesn't reveal an inner life . 
-1 the characterizations and dialogue lack depth or complexity , with the ironic exception of scooter . 
+1 in some ways , lagaan is quintessential bollywood . except it's much , much better . 
+1  . . . in no way original , or even all that memorable , but as downtown saturday matinee brain candy , it doesn't disappoint . 
+1 the saigon of 1952 is an uneasy mix of sensual delights and simmering violence , and the quiet american brings us right into the center of that world . 
+1 by the end of the movie , you're definitely convinced that these women are spectacular . 
+1 os problemas têm início a partir do momento em que saímos do cinema e começamos a pensar sobre o que acabamos de ver . É então que sinais realmente desaponta . 
-1 the movie's progression into rambling incoherence gives new meaning to the phrase 'fatal script error . '
-1 a film that loses sight of its own story . 
+1 so beautifully acted and directed , it's clear that washington most certainly has a new career ahead of him if he so chooses . 
-1 kung pow seems like some futile concoction that was developed hastily after oedekerk and his fellow moviemakers got through crashing a college keg party . 
+1 it's still a comic book , but maguire makes it a comic book with soul . 
+1 a must see for all sides of the political spectrum
+1 the second coming of harry potter is a film far superior to its predecessor . a movie that successfully crushes a best selling novel into a timeframe that mandates that you avoid the godzilla sized soda . 
+1 ramsay , as in ratcatcher , remains a filmmaker with an acid viewpoint and a real gift for teasing chilly poetry out of lives and settings that might otherwise seem drab and sordid . 
+1 a deft , delightful mix of sulky teen drama and overcoming-obstacles sports-movie triumph . 
-1 laughably , irredeemably awful . 
+1 while it regards 1967 as the key turning point of the 20th century , and returns again and again to images of dissidents in the streets , it's alarmingly current . 
-1 simply a re-hash of the other seven films . 
-1 essentially a collection of bits -- and they're all naughty . 
-1 the two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot , but so much naturalistic small talk , delivered in almost muffled exchanges , eventually has a lulling effect . 
+1 only two words will tell you what you know when deciding to see it : anthony . hopkins . 
-1 that such a horrible movie could have sprung from such a great one is one of the year's worst cinematic tragedies . 
-1 with generic sets and b-grade special effects , jason is about as convincing on the sci-fi front as tv's defunct cleopatra 2525 . 
+1 this concoction , so bizarre to the adult mind , is actually a charming triumph where its intended under-12 audience is concerned . 
-1 well-nigh unendurable . . . though the picture strains to become cinematic poetry , it remains depressingly prosaic and dull . 
+1 rife with the rueful , wry humor springing out of yiddish culture and language . 
+1 the film is . . . determined to treat its characters , weak and strong , as fallible human beings , not caricatures , and to carefully delineate the cost of the inevitable conflicts between human urges and an institution concerned with self-preservation . 
-1 even accepting this in the right frame of mind can only provide it with so much leniency . 
-1 a pale xerox of other , better crime movies . 
-1 it's a movie forged in the fires of chick flick hell . 
-1 dismally dull sci-fi comedy . 
+1 a clever blend of fact and fiction . 
+1 it's traditional moviemaking all the way , but it's done with a lot of careful period attention as well as some very welcome wit . 
+1  . . . a funny yet dark and seedy clash of cultures and generations . 
-1 anyway , for one reason or another , crush turns into a dire drama partway through . after that , it just gets stupid and maudlin . too bad , but thanks to some lovely comedic moments and several fine performances , it's not a total loss . 
-1 after a while , the only way for a reasonably intelligent person to get through the country bears is to ponder how a whole segment of pop-music history has been allowed to get wet , fuzzy and sticky . 
+1 with " ichi the killer " , takashi miike , japan's wildest filmmaker gives us a crime fighter carrying more emotional baggage than batman . . . 
+1 passion , melodrama , sorrow , laugther , and tears cascade over the screen effortlessly . . . 
-1 without shakespeare's eloquent language , the update is dreary and sluggish . 
+1 it's a square , sentimental drama that satisfies , as comfort food often can . 
-1 it's a gag that's worn a bit thin over the years , though don't ask still finds a few chuckles . 
+1 a minor film with major pleasures from portuguese master manoel de oliviera . . . 
+1 i stopped thinking about how good it all was , and started doing nothing but reacting to it - feeling a part of its grand locations , thinking urgently as the protagonists struggled , feeling at the mercy of its inventiveness , gasping at its visual delights . 
-1 for the future , one hopes mr . plympton will find room for one more member of his little band , a professional screenwriter . 
+1 as a randy film about sexy people in gorgeous places being pushed and pulled ( literally and figuratively ) by desire . . . [sex and lucía] makes for an arousing good time . 
-1 ultimately . . . the movie is too heady for children , and too preachy for adults . 
+1 unexpected moments of authentically impulsive humor are the hallmark of this bittersweet , uncommonly sincere movie that portrays the frank humanity ofemotional recovery . 
-1 unspeakable , of course , barely begins to describe the plot and its complications . vulgar is too optimistic a title . 
+1 the movie is beautiful to behold and engages one in a sense of epic struggle -- inner and outer -- that's all too rare in hollywood's hastier productions . 
-1 more of the same old garbage hollywood has been trying to pass off as acceptable teen entertainment for some time now . 
+1 ambitious , unsettling psychodrama that takes full , chilling advantage of its rough-around-the-edges , low-budget constraints . 
-1 the movie is a desperate miscalculation . it gives poor dana carvey nothing to do that is really funny , and then expects us to laugh because he acts so goofy all the time . 
+1 ryan gosling is , in a word , brilliant as the conflicted daniel . 
-1 a piece of mildly entertaining , inoffensive fluff that drifts aimlessly for 90 minutes before lodging in the cracks of that ever-growing category : unembarrassing but unmemorable . 
-1  " men in black ii , " has all the earmarks of a sequel . the story is less vibrant , the jokes are a little lukewarm , but will anyone really care ? 
-1 you're better off staying home and watching the x-files . 
+1 features fincher's characteristically startling visual style and an almost palpable sense of intensity . 
-1 it's never a good sign when a film's star spends the entirety of the film in a coma . it's a worse sign when you begin to envy her condition . 
+1 if there's nothing fresh about wannabes , which was written by mr . demeo , who produced and directed the film with charles a . addessi , much of the time the movie feels authentic . 
-1 i wonder what the reaction of israelis will be to this supposedly evenhanded presentation . 
-1 an unfortunate title for a film that has nothing endearing about it . 
+1 a compelling pre-wwii drama with vivid characters and a warm , moving message . 
-1 it's so downbeat and nearly humorless that it becomes a chore to sit through -- despite some first-rate performances by its lead . 
+1 ryan gosling . . . is at 22 a powerful young actor . 
-1 this is mild-mannered , been-there material given a pedestrian spin by a director who needed a touch of the flamboyant , the outrageous . 
-1 wallace directs with such patronising reverence , it turns the stomach . 
+1 on this tricky topic , tadpole is very much a step in the right direction , with its blend of frankness , civility and compassion . 
-1 the movie is as padded as allen's jelly belly . 
+1 it's somewhat clumsy and too lethargically paced -- but its story about a mysterious creature with psychic abilities offers a solid build-up , a terrific climax , and some nice chills along the way . 
-1 fessenden has nurtured his metaphors at the expense of his narrative , but he does display an original talent . 
-1 sunshine state surveys the landscape and assesses the issues with a clear passion for sociology . but the cinematography is cloudy , the picture making becalmed . 
-1 a cheap scam put together by some cynical creeps at revolution studios and imagine entertainment to make the suckers out there surrender $9 and 93 minutes of unrecoverable life . 
-1 the cumulative effect of the relentless horror on parade numbs the movie's power as a work of drama . 
+1  " punch-drunk love " is a little like a chocolate milk moustache . . . 
-1 displays the potential for a better movie than what bailly manages to deliver
+1 writer/ director m . night shyamalan's ability to pull together easily accessible stories that resonate with profundity is undeniable . 
+1 charles' entertaining film chronicles seinfeld's return to stand-up comedy after the wrap of his legendary sitcom , alongside wannabe comic adams' attempts to get his shot at the big time . 
-1 mostly , shafer and co-writer gregory hinton lack a strong-minded viewpoint , or a sense of humor . 
+1 the film's highlight is definitely its screenplay , both for the rhapsodic dialogue that jumps off the page , and for the memorable character creations . 
-1 despite the evocative aesthetics evincing the hollow state of modern love life , the film never percolates beyond a monotonous whine . 
+1 this clever caper movie has twists worthy of david mamet and is enormous fun for thinking audiences . 
-1 reggio's trippy , ambitious downer can also sometimes come across like nothing more than a glorified nike ad . 
-1 star trek : nemesis meekly goes where nearly every star trek movie has gone before . wince-inducing dialogue , thrift-shop costumes , prosthetic makeup by silly putty and kmart blue-light-special effects all conspire to test trekkie loyalty . 
+1 a french film with a more down-home flavor . 
-1 it's at once laughable and compulsively watchable , in its committed dumbness . 
-1 nelson's intentions are good , but the end result does no justice to the story itself . it's horribly depressing and not very well done . 
+1 it's a stunning lyrical work of considerable force and truth . 
+1 even if you don't know the band or the album's songs by heart , you will enjoy seeing how both evolve , and you will also learn a good deal about the state of the music business in the 21st century . 
-1 return to never land is much more p . c . than the original version ( no more racist portraits of indians , for instance ) , but the excitement is missing . 
+1 overcomes its visual hideousness with a sharp script and strong performances . 
-1 really does feel like a short stretched out to feature length . 
-1 every conceivable mistake a director could make in filming opera has been perpetrated here . 
+1 labute masterfully balances both traditional or modern stories together in a manner that one never overwhelms the other . something for everyone . 
-1 the acting is amateurish , the cinematography is atrocious , the direction is clumsy , the writing is insipid and the violence is at once luridly graphic and laughably unconvincing . 
+1 for a debut film , skin of man , heart of beast feels unusually assured . 
-1 offers absolutely nothing i hadn't already seen . 
+1 like many western action films , this thriller is too loud and thoroughly overbearing , but its heartfelt concern about north korea's recent past and south korea's future adds a much needed moral weight . 
-1 after the setup , the air leaks out of the movie , flattening its momentum with about an hour to go . 
-1 the gifted crudup has the perfect face to play a handsome blank yearning to find himself , and his cipherlike personality and bad behavior would play fine if the movie knew what to do with him . 
+1 it's an unusual , thoughtful bio-drama with a rich subject and some fantastic moments and scenes . 
+1 while the frequent allusions to gurus and doshas will strike some westerners as verging on mumbo-jumbo . . . broad streaks of common sense emerge with unimpeachable clarity . 
+1 it gives devastating testimony to both people's capacity for evil and their heroic capacity for good . 
+1 i have two words to say about reign of fire . great dragons ! 
-1 wins my vote for 'the 2002 enemy of cinema' award . 
+1 as improbable as this premise may seem , abbass's understated , shining performance offers us the sense that on some elemental level , lilia deeply wants to break free of her old life . 
+1 the beauty of alexander payne's ode to the everyman is in the details . 
+1 scott delivers a terrific performance in this fascinating portrait of a modern lothario . 
-1 traffics in the kind of prechewed racial clichés that have already been through the corporate stand-up-comedy mill . 
-1 like coming into a long-running , well-written television series where you've missed the first half-dozen episodes and probably won't see the next six . 
+1 a compelling motion picture that illustrates an american tragedy . 
-1 a man leaving the screening said the film was better than saving private ryan . he may have meant the internet short saving ryan's privates . but windtalkers doesn't beat that one , either . 
+1 a photographic marvel of sorts , and it's certainly an invaluable record of that special fishy community . 
+1 one of those rare films that seems as though it was written for no one , but somehow manages to convince almost everyone that it was put on the screen , just for them . 
+1 one of the finest , most humane and important holocaust movies ever made . 
+1 the movie , despite its rough edges and a tendency to sag in certain places , is wry and engrossing . 
-1 real-life strongman ahola lacks the charisma and ability to carry the film on his admittedly broad shoulders . 
-1 a pathetic exploitation film that tries to seem sincere , and just seems worse for the effort . 
+1 the inhospitability of the land emphasizes the spare precision of the narratives and helps to give them an atavistic power , as if they were tales that had been handed down since the beginning of time . 
+1 what makes the movie special is its utter sincerity . 
+1 ultimately too repellent to fully endear itself to american art house audiences , but it is notable for its stylistic austerity and forcefulness . 
+1  " auto focus " works as an unusual biopic and document of male swingers in the playboy era
+1 highly recommended as an engrossing story about a horrifying historical event and the elements which contributed to it . 
+1 the film's almost unbearable portrait of sadness and grief transcends its specific story to speak to the ways in which need , history and presumption tangle , and sometimes destroy , blood ties . 
+1 it would be disingenuous to call reno a great film , but you can say that about most of the flicks moving in and out of the multiplex . this is a movie that is what it is : a pleasant distraction , a friday night diversion , an excuse to eat popcorn . 
-1 mendes still doesn't quite know how to fill a frame . like the hanks character , he's a slow study : the action is stilted and the tabloid energy embalmed . 
+1 niccol the filmmaker merges his collaborators' symbolic images with his words , insinuating , for example , that in hollywood , only god speaks to the press
+1 against all odds in heaven and hell , it creeped me out just fine . 
-1 this is the kind of movie where the big scene is a man shot out of a cannon into a vat of ice cream . 
+1 as the dominant christine , sylvie testud is icily brilliant . 
+1 high crimes steals so freely from other movies and combines enough disparate types of films that it can't help but engage an audience . 
-1 viewers are asked so often to suspend belief that were it not for holm's performance , the film would be a total washout . 
-1 been there , done that . . . a thousand times already , and better . 
-1 by the end of it all i sort of loved the people onscreen , even though i could not stand them . perhaps the film should be seen as a conversation starter . it's not an easy one to review . 
-1 everything about girls can't swim , even its passages of sensitive observation , feels secondhand , familiar -- and not in a good way . 
-1 perry's good and his is an interesting character , but " serving sara " hasn't much more to serve than silly fluff . nor is it a romantic comedy . 
+1 a frustrating yet deeply watchable melodrama that makes you think it's a tougher picture than it is . 
-1 imagine if you will a tony hawk skating video interspliced with footage from behind enemy lines and set to jersey shore techno . 
-1 not only does the movie fail to make us part of its reality , it fails the most basic relevancy test as well . 
-1 you wonder why enough wasn't just a music video rather than a full-length movie . 
-1 one of those based-on-truth stories that persuades you , with every scene , that it could never really have happened this way . 
-1 proof that a thriller can be sleekly shot , expertly cast , paced with crisp professionalism . . . and still be a letdown if its twists and turns hold no more surprise than yesterday's weather report . 
-1 the lower your expectations , the more you'll enjoy it . 
+1 though this film can be clumsy , its ambitions are equally -- and admirably -- uncommercial . 
-1 the plot is straight off the shelf , the performances are television- caliber and the message of providing solace through deception is a little creepy . 
-1 to blandly go where we went 8 movies ago . . . 
-1 the master of disguise represents adam sandler's latest attempt to dumb down the universe . 
+1 though overall an overwhelmingly positive portrayal , the film doesn't ignore the more problematic aspects of brown's life . 
-1 a mixed bag of a comedy that can't really be described as out of this world . 
+1 a romantic comedy that operates by the rules of its own self-contained universe . 
-1 a series of immaculately composed shots of patch adams quietly freaking out does not make for much of a movie . 
+1 this is wild surreal stuff , but brilliant and the camera just kind of sits there and lets you look at this and its like you're going from one room to the next and none of them have any relation to the other . 
-1 what's next ? rob schneider , dana carvey and sarah michelle gellar in the philadelphia story ? david spade as citizen kane ? 
+1 this is the kind of subject matter that could so easily have been fumbled by a lesser filmmaker , but ayres makes the right choices at every turn . 
-1 if it's another regurgitated action movie you're after , there's no better film than half past dead . 
+1 nicole kidman makes it a party worth attending . 
-1 mindless and boring martial arts and gunplay with too little excitement and zero compelling storyline . 
+1 a perfectly pleasant if slightly pokey comedy . 
+1 even if it pushes its agenda too forcefully , this remains a film about something , one that attempts and often achieves a level of connection and concern . 
+1 ford deserves to be remembered at oscar time for crafting this wonderful portrait of a conflicted soldier . 
-1 shows moments of promise but ultimately succumbs to cliches and pat storytelling . 
-1 a fascinating but choppy documentary . 
-1 woody , what happened ? 
-1 what starts off as a possible argentine american beauty reeks like a room stacked with pungent flowers . 
+1 escapes the precious trappings of most romantic comedies , infusing into the story very real , complicated emotions . 
-1 the whole thing plays out with the drowsy heaviness of synchronized swimmer wearing a wool wetsuit . 
+1 as part of mr . dong's continuing exploration of homosexuality in america , family fundamentals is an earnest study in despair . 
+1 the film proves unrelentingly grim -- and equally engrossing . 
+1 this time , the hype is quieter , and while the movie is slightly less successful than the first , it's still a rollicking good time for the most part . 
+1 a meditation on faith and madness , frailty is blood-curdling stuff . 
+1 this rich , bittersweet israeli documentary , about the life of song-and-dance-man pasach'ke burstein and his family , transcends ethnic lines . 
-1 this remake of lina wertmuller's 1975 eroti-comedy might just be the biggest husband-and-wife disaster since john and bo derek made the ridiculous bolero . 
+1 stage director sam mendes showcases tom hanks as a depression era hit-man in this dark tale of revenge . 
+1 it's fun , splashy and entertainingly nasty . 
+1 i'm sure mainstream audiences will be baffled , but , for those with at least a minimal appreciation of woolf and clarissa dalloway , the hours represents two of those well spent . 
-1 by the time the plot grinds itself out in increasingly incoherent fashion , you might be wishing for a watch that makes time go faster rather than the other way around . 
-1 philosophically , intellectually and logistically a mess . 
+1 it says a lot about a filmmaker when he can be wacky without clobbering the audience over the head and still maintain a sense of urgency and suspense . 
-1 it's not original enough . 
-1 even with harris's strong effort , the script gives him little to effectively probe lear's soul-stripping breakdown . 
+1 when your leading ladies are a couple of screen-eating dominatrixes like goldie hawn and susan sarandon at their raunchy best , even hokum goes down easily . 
+1 return to never land may be another shameless attempt by disney to rake in dough from baby boomer families , but it's not half-bad . 
-1 helmer devito . . . attempts to do too many things in this story about ethics , payola , vice , murder , kids' tv and revenge . 
+1 it reaffirms life as it looks in the face of death . 
-1 secret ballot is too contemplative to be really funny . 
-1 mcconaughey's fun to watch , the dragons are okay , not much fire in the script . 
+1 the actresses find their own rhythm and protect each other from the script's bad ideas and awkwardness . 
-1 however it may please those who love movies that blare with pop songs , young science fiction fans will stomp away in disgust . 
+1 it's one of the most honest films ever made about hollywood . 
+1  . it's a testament to the film's considerable charm that it succeeds in entertaining , despite playing out like a feature-length sitcom replete with stereotypical familial quandaries . there's a sheer unbridled delight in the way the story unfurls . . . 
-1 sets up a nice concept for its fiftysomething leading ladies , but fails loudly in execution . 
-1 bad in such a bizarre way that it's almost worth seeing , if only to witness the crazy confluence of purpose and taste . 
-1 the film is really closer to porn than a serious critique of what's wrong with this increasingly pervasive aspect of gay culture . 
+1 it will not appeal to the impatient , but those who like long books and movies will admire the way it accumulates power and depth . 
-1 what happened with pluto nash ? how did it ever get made ? 
-1 just isn't as weird as it ought to be . 
-1 earnest and tentative even when it aims to shock . 
-1 forget the psychology 101 study of romantic obsession and just watch the procession of costumes in castles and this won't seem like such a bore . 
-1 this is the first film i've ever seen that had no obvious directing involved . 
-1 as original and insightful as last week's episode of behind the music . 
+1 one of the best examples of how to treat a subject , you're not fully aware is being examined , much like a photo of yourself you didn't know was being taken . 
+1 is it a total success ? no . is it something any true film addict will want to check out ? you bet . 
-1 truly terrible . 
-1 the sequel plays out like a flimsy excuse to give blade fans another look at wesley snipes' iconic hero doing battle with dozens of bad guys -- at once . 
+1 what's surprising is how well it holds up in an era in which computer-generated images are the norm . 
-1 it's fitfully funny but never really takes off . 
+1 by presenting an impossible romance in an impossible world , pumpkin dares us to say why either is impossible -- which forces us to confront what's possible and what we might do to make it so . 
-1 this is really just another genre picture . 
+1 so purely enjoyable that you might not even notice it's a fairly straightforward remake of hollywood comedies such as father of the bride . 
+1 over the years , hollywood has crafted a solid formula for successful animated movies , and ice age only improves on it , with terrific computer graphics , inventive action sequences and a droll sense of humor . 
+1 the film is often filled with a sense of pure wonderment and excitement not often seen in today's cinema du sarcasm
+1 angela gheorghiu as famous prima donna floria tosca , roberto alagna as her lover mario cavaradossi , and ruggero as the villainous , lecherous police chief scarpia , all sing beautifully and act adequately . 
-1 unless there are zoning ordinances to protect your community from the dullest science fiction , impostor is opening today at a theater near you . 
+1 it's refreshing to see a romance this smart . 
-1 lan yu is certainly a serviceable melodrama , but it doesn't even try for the greatness that happy together shoots for ( and misses ) . 
-1 its well of thorn and vinegar ( and simple humanity ) has long been plundered by similar works featuring the insight and punch this picture so conspicuously lacks . 
-1 this ill-fitting tuxedo is strictly off-the-rack . 
-1 watching queen of the damned is like reading a research paper , with special effects tossed in . 
-1 a sugar-coated rocky whose valuable messages are forgotten 10 minutes after the last trombone honks . 
-1 as earnest as a community-college advertisement , american chai is enough to make you put away the guitar , sell the amp , and apply to medical school . 
+1 this big screen caper has a good bark , far from being a bow-wow . 
+1 best of all is garcia , who perfectly portrays the desperation of a very insecure man . 
+1 it's pretty linear and only makeup-deep , but bogdanovich ties it together with efficiency and an affection for the period . 
-1 reno does what he can in a thankless situation , the film ricochets from humor to violence and back again , and ryoko hirosue makes us wonder if she is always like that . 
-1 pumpkin sits in a patch somewhere between mirthless todd solondzian satire and callow student film . 
+1 this is more fascinating -- being real -- than anything seen on jerry springer . 
-1 [e]ventually , every idea in this film is flushed down the latrine of heroism . 
+1 it's rather like a lifetime special -- pleasant , sweet and forgettable . 
+1 one of the best films of the year with its exploration of the obstacles to happiness faced by five contemporary individuals . . . a psychological masterpiece . 
+1 a sensitive , modest comic tragedy that works as both character study and symbolic examination of the huge economic changes sweeping modern china . 
+1 this is one of the outstanding thrillers of recent years . 
-1 at times , however , dogtown and z-boys lapses into an insider's lingo and mindset that the uninitiated may find hard to follow , or care about . 
-1 the film is so busy making reference to other films and trying to be other films that it fails to have a heart , mind or humor of its own . 
-1 if hill isn't quite his generation's don siegel ( or robert aldrich ) , it's because there's no discernible feeling beneath the chest hair ; it's all bluster and cliché . 
+1 a thought-provoking and often-funny drama about isolation . 
-1 a little weak -- and it isn't that funny . 
-1 a cleverly crafted but ultimately hollow mockumentary . 
+1 finely crafted , finely written , exquisitely performed
-1  . . . the whole thing succeeded only in making me groggy . 
-1 almost as offensive as " freddy got fingered . " 
-1  . . . perhaps the heaviest , most joyless movie ever made about giant dragons taking over the world . 
+1 evokes the 19th century with a subtlety that is an object lesson in period filmmaking . 
+1 finally , a genre movie that delivers -- in a couple of genres , no less . 
-1  . . . think of it as american pie on valium . 
+1 hardly a film that comes along every day . 
-1 the acting is stiff , the story lacks all trace of wit , the sets look like they were borrowed from gilligan's island -- and the cgi scooby might well be the worst special-effects creation of the year . 
-1 rymer doesn't trust laughs -- and doesn't conjure proper respect for followers of the whole dead-undead genre , who deserve more from a vampire pic than a few shrieky special effects . 
-1 [i]t's certainly laudable that the movie deals with hot-button issues in a comedic context , but barbershop isn't as funny as it should be . 
-1 an unclassifiably awful study in self- and audience-abuse . 
-1 don't be fooled by the impressive cast list - eye see you is pure junk . 
-1 wallace seems less like he's been burning to tell a war story than he's been itching to somehow tack one together
-1 in theory , a middle-aged romance pairing clayburgh and tambor sounds promising , but in practice it's something else altogether -- clownish and offensive and nothing at all like real life . 
-1 watchable up until the point where the situations and the dialogue spin hopelessly out of control -- that is to say , when carol kane appears on the screen . 
-1 it's really yet another anemic and formulaic lethal weapon-derived buddy-cop movie , trying to pass off its lack of imagination as hip knowingness . 
+1 the fluid motion is astounding on any number of levels -- including the physical demands made on büttner -- and it implies in its wake the intractable , irreversible flow of history . 
+1 great over-the-top moviemaking if you're in a slap-happy mood . 
+1  . . . blade ii is more enjoyable than the original . 
-1 jolie's performance vanishes somewhere between her hair and her lips . 
-1 the film takes too long getting to the good stuff , then takes too long figuring out what to do next . 
+1 the story . . . is inspiring , ironic , and revelatory of just how ridiculous and money-oriented the record industry really is . it is also a testament to the integrity and vision of the band . 
+1 there's something about a marching band that gets me where i live . 
-1 naipaul fans may be disappointed . those who are not acquainted with the author's work , on the other hand , may fall fast asleep . 
+1 as a revenge thriller , the movie is serviceable , but it doesn't really deliver the delicious guilty pleasure of the better film versions . 
+1 amari has dressed up this little parable in a fairly irresistible package full of privileged moments and memorable performances . 
-1 a combination of standard , stiff tv-style animation and snazzy-looking digital effects that do little to disguise the fact that the characters barely move . 
-1 the basic premise is intriguing but quickly becomes distasteful and downright creepy . 
+1 perhaps it's cliche to call the film 'refreshing , ' but it is . 'drumline' shows a level of young , black manhood that is funny , touching , smart and complicated . 
-1 [p]artnering murphy with robert de niro for the tv-cops comedy showtime would seem to be surefire casting . the catch is that they're stuck with a script that prevents them from firing on all cylinders . 
+1 mark pellington's latest pop thriller is as kooky and overeager as it is spooky and subtly in love with myth . 
-1 adam sandler is to gary cooper what a gnat is to a racehorse . 
-1 it's pretentious in a way that verges on the amateurish . 
-1 [jackson and bledel] seem to have been picked not for their acting chops , but for their looks and appeal to the pre-teen crowd . 
+1 it thankfully goes easy on the reel/real world dichotomy that [jaglom] pursued with such enervating determination in venice/venice . 
+1  " on guard ! " won't be placed in the pantheon of the best of the swashbucklers but it is a whole lot of fun and you get to see the one of the world's best actors , daniel auteuil , have a whale of a good time . 
+1 secretary is just too original to be ignored . 
-1 no telegraphing is too obvious or simplistic for this movie . 
+1 in scope , ambition and accomplishment , children of the century . . . takes kurys' career to a whole new level . 
-1 a ragbag of promising ideas and failed narrative , of good acting and plain old bad filmmaking . 
-1 'it's painful to watch witherspoon's talents wasting away inside unnecessary films like legally blonde and sweet home abomination , i mean , alabama . '
+1 at its best . . . festival in cannes bubbles with the excitement of the festival in cannes . 
-1 so relentlessly wholesome it made me want to swipe something . 
-1 [siegel] and co-writers lisa bazadona and grace woodard have relied too much on convention in creating the characters who surround frankie . 
-1 this charmless nonsense ensues amid clanging film references that make jay and silent bob's excellent adventure seem understated . 
-1 the merchant-ivory team continues to systematically destroy everything we hold dear about cinema , only now it's begun to split up so that it can do even more damage . 
-1 a dim-witted and lazy spin-off of the animal planet documentary series , crocodile hunter is entertainment opportunism at its most glaring . 
-1 none of this so-called satire has any sting to it , as if woody is afraid of biting the hand that has finally , to some extent , warmed up to him . 
-1 a bit too eager to please . 
+1 it must be the end of the world : the best film so far this year is a franchise sequel starring wesley snipes . 
-1 [macdowell] ventures beyond her abilities several times here and reveals how bad an actress she is . 
+1 a tasty slice of droll whimsy . 
-1 the characters . . . are paper-thin , and their personalities undergo radical changes when it suits the script . 
+1 a quiet , pure , elliptical film
+1 combines improbable melodrama ( gored bullfighters , comatose ballerinas ) with subtly kinky bedside vigils and sensational denouements , and yet at the end , we are undeniably touched . 
-1 instead of letting the laughs come as they may , lawrence unleashes his trademark misogyny -- er , comedy -- like a human volcano or an overflowing septic tank , take your pick . 
+1  . . . a story , an old and scary one , about the monsters we make , and the vengeance they take . 
-1 'dragonfly' is a movie about a bus wreck that turns into a film wreck . 
+1 neither parker nor donovan is a typical romantic lead , but they bring a fresh , quirky charm to the formula . 
-1 sometimes this modest little number clicks , and sometimes it doesn't . 
+1 there's very little sense to what's going on here , but the makers serve up the cliches with considerable dash . 
+1 the socio-histo-political treatise is told in earnest strides . . . [and] personal illusion is deconstructed with poignancy . 
-1 the structure the film takes may find matt damon and ben affleck once again looking for residuals as this officially completes a good will hunting trilogy that was never planned . 
+1 like a less dizzily gorgeous companion to mr . wong's in the mood for love -- very much a hong kong movie despite its mainland setting . 
+1 can i admit xxx is as deep as a petri dish and as well-characterized as a telephone book but still say it was a guilty pleasure ? 
-1 while the story is better-focused than the incomprehensible anne rice novel it's based upon , queen of the damned is a pointless , meandering celebration of the goth-vampire , tortured woe-is-me lifestyle . 
+1 the fascination comes in the power of the huston performance , which seems so larger than life and yet so fragile , and in the way the ivan character accepts the news of his illness so quickly but still finds himself unable to react . 
-1 the pivotal narrative point is so ripe the film can't help but go soft and stinky . 
+1 take care is nicely performed by a quintet of actresses , but nonetheless it drags during its 112-minute length . 
-1 suffers from unlikable characters and a self-conscious sense of its own quirky hipness . 
+1 a worthy addition to the cinematic canon , which , at last count , numbered 52 different versions . 
-1 an empty exercise , a florid but ultimately vapid crime melodrama with lots of surface flash but little emotional resonance . 
-1 a film that presents an interesting , even sexy premise then ruins itself with too many contrivances and goofy situations . 
+1 i had a dream that a smart comedy would come along to rescue me from a summer of teen-driven , toilet-humor codswallop , and its name was earnest . 
+1 there's not much more to this adaptation of the nick hornby novel than charm -- effortless , pleasurable , featherweight charm . 
-1 meandering , sub-aquatic mess : it's so bad it's good , but only if you slide in on a freebie . 
+1 what makes esther kahn so demanding is that it progresses in such a low-key manner that it risks monotony . but it's worth the concentration . 
+1 argento , at only 26 , brings a youthful , out-to-change-the-world aggressiveness to the project , as if she's cut open a vein and bled the raw film stock . 
+1 cq's reflection of artists and the love of cinema-and-self suggests nothing less than a new voice that deserves to be considered as a possible successor to the best european directors . 
-1 the only camouflage carvey should now be considering is a paper bag to wear over his head when he goes out into public , to avoid being recognized as the man who bilked unsuspecting moviegoers . 
-1 this misty-eyed southern nostalgia piece , in treading the line between sappy and sanguine , winds up mired in tear-drenched quicksand . 
+1 sensitive , insightful and beautifully rendered film . one of the best of the year . 
+1 this is pure , exciting moviemaking . you won't exactly know what's happening but you'll be blissfully exhausted . 
-1 offensive in the way it exploits the hot-button issue of domestic abuse for cheap thrills and disgusting in the manner it repeatedly puts a small child in jeopardy , treating her as little more than a prop to be cruelly tormented . 
+1 brims with passion : for words , for its eccentric , accident-prone characters , and for the crazy things that keep people going in this crazy life . 
+1 an excellent romp that boasts both a heart and a mind . 
+1 it has a caffeinated , sloppy brilliance , sparkling with ideas you wish had been developed with more care , but animated by an energy that puts the dutiful efforts of more disciplined grade-grubbers to shame . 
+1 chaiken ably balances real-time rhythms with propulsive incident . 
-1 we never feel anything for these characters , and as a result the film is basically just a curiosity . 
-1 it winds up moving in many directions as it searches ( vainly , i think ) for something fresh to say . 
-1 it appears to have been modeled on the worst revenge-of-the-nerds clichés the filmmakers could dredge up . 
-1 blue crush is as predictable as the tides . . . . the movie feels stitched together from stock situations and characters from other movies . 
+1 the ingenuity that parker displays in freshening the play is almost in a class with that of wilde himself . 
+1 although shot with little style , skins is heartfelt and achingly real . 
-1 this mild-mannered farce , directed by one of its writers , john c . walsh , is corny in a way that bespeaks an expiration date passed a long time ago . 
-1 directed in a paint-by-numbers manner . 
-1 lisa rinzler's cinematography may be lovely , but love liza's tale itself virtually collapses into an inhalant blackout , maintaining consciousness just long enough to achieve callow pretension . 
-1 a thinly veiled excuse for wilson to play his self-deprecating act against murphy's well-honed prima donna shtick . 
-1 scarcely worth a mention apart from reporting on the number of tumbleweeds blowing through the empty theatres graced with its company . 
+1 because the film deliberately lacks irony , it has a genuine dramatic impact ; it plays like a powerful 1957 drama we've somehow never seen before . 
+1  . . . a powerful sequel and one of the best films of the year . 
+1 a sharp , amusing study of the cult of celebrity . 
-1 the work of an exhausted , desiccated talent who can't get out of his own way . 
-1 enough similarities to gymkata and howie long's firestorm that my fingernails instinctively crawled towards my long-suffering eyeballs . 
-1 written , flatly , by david kendall and directed , barely , by there's something about mary co-writer ed decter . 
+1 for those who pride themselves on sophisticated , discerning taste , this might not seem like the proper cup of tea , however it is almost guaranteed that even the stuffiest cinema goers will laugh their * * * off for an hour-and-a-half . 
-1 too bad kramer couldn't make a guest appearance to liven things up . 
+1 a wild , endearing , masterful documentary . 
-1 comedy troupe broken lizard's first movie is very funny but too concerned with giving us a plot . 
+1 it's a movie -- and an album -- you won't want to miss . 
-1 [director] byler may yet have a great movie in him , but charlotte sometimes is only half of one . 
+1 the viewer takes great pleasure in watching the resourceful molly stay a step ahead of her pursuers . 
-1 denis o'neill's script avoids the prime sports cliche , a last-second goal to win the championship , but it neglects few others . 
+1 an uncomfortable movie , suffocating and sometimes almost senseless , the grey zone does have a center , though a morbid one . 
-1 even the imaginative gore can't hide the musty scent of todd farmer's screenplay , which is a simple retread of the 1979 alien , with a plucky heroine battling a monster loose in a spaceship . 
+1 visually breathtaking , viscerally exciting , and dramatically moving , it's the very definition of epic adventure . 
-1 plays like a checklist of everything rob reiner and his cast were sending up . 
-1 about one in three gags in white's intermittently wise script hits its mark ; the rest are padding unashamedly appropriated from the teen-exploitation playbook . 
-1 'a' for creativity but comes across more as a sketch for a full-length comedy . 
+1 it's been made with an innocent yet fervid conviction that our hollywood has all but lost . 
-1 well , jason's gone to manhattan and hell , i guess a space station in the year 2455 can be crossed off the list of ideas for the inevitable future sequels ( hey , don't shoot the messenger ) .

-1 demands too much of most viewers .

+1 miyazaki has created such a vibrant , colorful world , it's almost impossible not to be swept away by the sheer beauty of his images . 
-1 does little to elaborate the conceit of setting this blood-soaked tragedy of murderous ambition in the era of richard nixon . 
-1 scarlet diva has a voyeuristic tug , but all in all it's a lot less sensational than it wants to be .

+1 wang xiaoshuai directs this intricately structured and well-realized drama that presents a fascinating glimpse of urban life and the class warfare that embroils two young men . 
+1 fresnadillo has something serious to say about the ways in which extravagant chance can distort our perspective and throw us off the path of good sense . 
-1 it would work much better as a one-hour tv documentary . 
+1 you could say that it's slow at times , you could say that a few of the characters act in ways that real people wouldn't , but one thing you couldn't say is that alias betty is predictable . 
-1 too much of it feels unfocused and underdeveloped . 
+1 the quirky and recessive charms of co-stars martin donovan and mary-louise parker help overcome the problematic script . 
+1 it's a tour de force , written and directed so quietly that it's implosion rather than explosion you fear . 
+1 what eric schaeffer has accomplished with never again may not , strictly speaking , qualify as revolutionary . but it's defiantly and delightfully against the grain . 
-1 any intellectual arguments being made about the nature of god are framed in a drama so clumsy , there is a real danger less sophisticated audiences will mistake it for an endorsement of the very things that bean abhors . 
+1  . . . digs beyond the usual portrayals of good kids and bad seeds to reveal a more ambivalent set of characters and motivations . 
+1 the plot of the comeback curlers isn't very interesting actually , but what i like about men with brooms and what is kind of special is how the film knows what's unique and quirky about canadians . 
+1 samuel beckett applied to the iranian voting process . 
+1 kinnear gives a tremendous performance . 
-1 filled with low-brow humor , gratuitous violence and a disturbing disregard for life .

+1 a giddy and provocative sexual romp that has something to say . 
-1 is anyone else out there getting tired of the whole slo-mo , double-pistoled , ballistic-pyrotechnic hong kong action aesthetic ? 
-1 wishy-washy . 
-1 high drama , disney-style - a wing and a prayer and a hunky has-been pursuing his castle in the sky . 
+1 the movie is a trove of delights . 
-1 brown's saga , like many before his , makes for snappy prose but a stumblebum of a movie . 
-1 this is a monumental achievement in practically every facet of inept filmmaking : joyless , idiotic , annoying , heavy-handed , visually atrocious , and often downright creepy . 
-1 but buying into sham truths and routine " indie " filmmaking , freundlich has made just another safe movie . it's not horrible , just horribly mediocre . 
-1 his [nelson's] screenplay needs some serious re-working to show more of the dilemma , rather than have his characters stage shouting matches about it . 
-1 arnold's jump from little screen to big will leave frowns on more than a few faces . 
+1  a thought-provoking look at how western foreign policy - however well intentioned - can wreak havoc in other cultures . 
+1 branagh , in his most forceful non-shakespeare screen performance , grounds even the softest moments in the angry revolt of his wit .

-1 it's a road-trip drama with too many wrong turns . 
-1 two tedious acts light on great scares and a good surprise ending . 
-1  . . . a low rate annie featuring some kid who can't act , only echoes of jordan , and weirdo actor crispin glover screwing things up old school . 
+1 a tone of rueful compassion . . . reverberates throughout this film , whose meaning and impact is sadly heightened by current world events .

+1 it pulls the rug out from under you , just when you're ready to hate one character , or really sympathize with another character , something happens to send you off in different direction . 
-1 bartleby is a one-joke movie , and a bad joke at that . 
-1 oedekerk wrote patch adams , for which he should not be forgiven . why he was given free reign over this project -- he wrote , directed , starred and produced -- is beyond me .

+1 the script is smart , not cloying . 
+1 an alternately fascinating and frustrating documentary . 
+1  " home movie " is a sweet treasure and something well worth your time . 
-1 uneasy mishmash of styles and genres . 
-1 has none of the crackle of " fatal attraction " , " 9 ½ weeks " , or even " indecent proposal " , and feels more like lyne's stolid remake of " lolita " . 
+1 this remake gets all there is to get out of a peculiar premise with promise : al pacino loathing robin williams . 
-1 the best drug addition movies are usually depressing but rewarding . quitting , however , manages just to be depressing , as the lead actor phones in his autobiographical performance .

+1 allen se atreve a atacar , a atacarse y nos ofrece gags que van de la sonrisa a la risa de larga duración
+1 it's not a classic spy-action or buddy movie , but it's entertaining enough and worth a look . 
-1 barrels along at the start before becoming mired in sentimentality . 
+1 it suggests the wide-ranging effects of media manipulation , from the kind of reporting that is done by the supposedly liberal media . . . to the intimate and ultimately tragic heartache of maverick individuals like hatfield and hicks . 
-1 tambor and clayburgh make an appealing couple  he's understated and sardonic , she's appealingly manic and energetic . both deserve better .

-1 only in its final surprising shots does rabbit-proof fence find the authority it's looking for . 
+1 the success of undercover brother is found in its ability to spoof both black and white stereotypes equally . 
-1 though there are entertaining and audacious moments , the movie's wildly careening tone and an extremely flat lead performance do little to salvage this filmmaker's flailing reputation . 
+1 it lets you brush up against the humanity of a psycho , without making him any less psycho .

-1 an exercise in cynicism every bit as ugly as the shabby digital photography and muddy sound .

+1 reign of fire just might go down as one of the all-time great apocalypse movies . 
-1  . . . a bland , pretentious mess . 
-1  . . . a movie that , quite simply , shouldn't have been made . 
-1 in the book-on-tape market , the film of " the kid stays in the picture " would be an abridged edition
+1 it's a day at the beach -- with air conditioning and popcorn . 
-1 little more than a super-sized infomercial for the cable-sports channel and its summer x games . 
+1 the unique tug-of-war with viewer expectations is undeniable , if not a pleasure in its own right . 
+1 wickedly funny , visually engrossing , never boring , this movie challenges us to think about the ways we consume pop culture . 
-1 what's really sad is to see two academy award winning actresses ( and one academy award winning actor ) succumb to appearing in this junk that's tv sitcom material at best .

-1 an awkward and indigestible movie .

+1 often hilarious , well-shot and , importantly , entertaining , hell house is a fascinating document of an event that has to be seen to be believed . 
-1 this low-rent -- and even lower-wit -- rip-off of the farrelly brothers' oeuvre gets way too mushy -- and in a relatively short amount of time . 
-1 shunji iwai's all about lily chou chou is a beautifully shot , but ultimately flawed film about growing up in japan . 
-1 [screenwriter] pimental took the farrelly brothers comedy and feminized it , but it is a rather poor imitation . 
-1 bears about as much resemblance to the experiences of most battered women as spider-man does to the experiences of most teenagers . 
+1 disney aficionados will notice distinct parallels between this story and the 1971 musical " bedknobs and broomsticks , " which also dealt with british children rediscovering the power of fantasy during wartime . 
+1 it's as close as we'll ever come to looking through a photographer's viewfinder as he works . 
-1 how do you make a movie with depth about a man who lacked any ? on the evidence before us , the answer is clear : not easily and , in the end , not well enough . 
-1 a sleek advert for youthful anomie that never quite equals the sum of its pretensions . 
-1 a tired , unnecessary retread . . . a stale copy of a picture that wasn't all that great to begin with . 
+1 for a good chunk of its running time , trapped is an effective and claustrophobic thriller . 
-1 the chateau . . . is less concerned with cultural and political issues than doting on its eccentric characters . 
+1 an extremely funny , ultimately heartbreaking look at life in contemporary china . 
+1 visually fascinating . . . an often intense character study about fathers and sons , loyalty and duty . 
-1 one regards reign of fire with awe . what a vast enterprise has been marshaled in the service of such a minute idea . 
+1 either a fascinating study of the relationship between mothers and their children or a disturbing story about sociopaths and their marks . 
+1 enjoyably fast-moving , hard-hitting documentary . 
-1 it's not helpful to listen to extremist name-calling , regardless of whether you think kissinger was a calculating fiend or just a slippery self-promoter . 
+1 morton uses her face and her body language to bring us morvern's soul , even though the character is almost completely deadpan . 
+1 at its worst , the movie is pretty diverting ; the pity is that it rarely achieves its best . 
-1 this ludicrous film is predictable at every turn . 
+1 an elegant , exquisitely modulated psychological thriller . 
+1 the two leads , nearly perfect in their roles , bring a heart and reality that buoy the film , and at times , elevate it to a superior crime movie . 
+1 the chateau belongs to rudd , whose portrait of a therapy-dependent flakeball spouting french malapropisms . . . is a nonstop hoot . 
+1 a sexy , peculiar and always entertaining costume drama set in renaissance spain , and the fact that it's based on true events somehow makes it all the more compelling . 
+1 it's quaid who anchors the film with his effortless performance and that trademark grin of his -- so perfect for a ballplayer . 
-1 i've seen some bad singer-turned actors , but lil bow wow takes the cake . 
-1  . . . ice age treads predictably along familiar territory , making it a passable family film that won't win many fans over the age of 12 . 
+1 a solid cast , assured direction and complete lack of modern day irony . 
+1 it turns out to be a cut above the norm , thanks to some clever writing and sprightly acting . 
+1 here's yet another cool crime movie that actually manages to bring something new into the mix . 
+1 gondry's direction is adequate . . . but what gives human nature its unique feel is kaufman's script . 
+1 an absorbing trip into the minds and motivations of people under stress as well as a keen , unsentimental look at variations on the theme of motherhood . 
-1 devolves into the derivative , leaning on badly-rendered cgi effects . 
+1 this is a sincerely crafted picture that deserves to emerge from the traffic jam of holiday movies . 
+1 classic cinema served up with heart and humor
-1 under 15 ? a giggle a minute . over age 15 ? big fat waste of time . 
+1 woven together handsomely , recalling sixties' rockumentary milestones from lonely boy to don't look back . 
+1 a journey that is as difficult for the audience to take as it is for the protagonist -- yet it's potentially just as rewarding . 
-1 had the film boasted a clearer , more memorable , the creepiness would have gotten under the skin . 
-1 american chai encourages rueful laughter at stereotypes only an indian-american would recognize . and the lesson , in the end , is nothing new . 
-1 a lackluster , unessential sequel to the classic disney adaptation of j . m . barrie's peter pan . 
+1 tackles the difficult subject of grief and loss with such life-embracing spirit that the theme doesn't drag an audience down . 
-1 throughout all the tumult , a question comes to mind : so why is this so boring ? 
+1 thanks to the château's balance of whimsicality , narrative discipline and serious improvisation , almost every relationship and personality in the film yields surprises . 
-1 you cannot guess why the cast and crew didn't sign a pact to burn the negative and the script and pretend the whole thing never existed . 
+1 anchored by a terrific performance by abbass , satin rouge shows that the idea of women's self-actualization knows few continental divides . 
+1 witherspoon puts to rest her valley-girl image , but it's dench who really steals the show . 
-1  . . . feels as if ( there's ) a choke leash around your neck so director nick cassavetes can give it a good , hard yank whenever he wants you to feel something . 
+1 this cinema verite speculation on the assassination of john f . kennedy may have been inspired by blair witch , but it takes its techniques into such fresh territory that the film never feels derivative . 
+1 your response to its new sequel , analyze that , may hinge on what you thought of the first film . 
+1 its mysteries are transparently obvious , and it's too slowly paced to be a thriller . [but it's] worth recommending because of two marvelous performances by michael caine and brendan fraser . 
+1 an hour and a half of joyful solo performance . 
-1 jonah is only so-so . . . the addition of a biblical message will either improve the film for you , or it will lessen it . 
-1 the movie's something-borrowed construction feels less the product of loving , well integrated homage and more like a mere excuse for the wan , thinly sketched story . killing time , that's all that's going on here . 
-1 a derivative collection of horror and sci-fi cliches . 
+1 the script is smart and dark - hallelujah for small favors . 
-1 go , girls , right down the reality drain . 
-1 the result , however well-intentioned , is ironically just the sort of disposable , kitchen-sink homage that illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today's hollywood . 
+1 it's hard not to be seduced by [witherspoon's] charisma , even in this run-of-the-mill vehicle , because this girl knows how to drive it to the max . 
+1 o fantasma is boldly , confidently orchestrated , aesthetically and sexually , and its impact is deeply and rightly disturbing . 
+1 [ramsay] visually transforms the dreary expanse of dead-end distaste the characters inhabit into a poem of art , music and metaphor . 
-1 i thought my own watch had stopped keeping time as i slogged my way through clockstoppers . 
-1 'carente de imaginación , mal dirigida , peor actuada y sin un ápice de romance , es una verdadera pérdida de tiempo y dinero'
-1 ultimately the project comes across as clinical , detached , uninvolving , possibly prompting audience members to wonder , 'what's the point ? '
-1 can't seem to get anywhere near the story's center . 
+1 nothing short of wonderful with its ten-year-old female protagonist and its steadfast refusal to set up a dualistic battle between good and evil . 
+1 a journey through memory , a celebration of living , and a sobering rumination on fatality , classism , and ignorance . 
+1 allen's underestimated charm delivers more goodies than lumps of coal . 
-1 though it inspires some ( out-of-field ) creative thought , the film is -- to its own detriment -- much more a cinematic collage than a polemical tract . 
-1 the entire point of a shaggy dog story , of course , is that it goes nowhere , and this is classic nowheresville in every sense . 
+1 an unusually dry-eyed , even analytical approach to material that is generally played for maximum moisture . 
-1 this director's cut -- which adds 51 minutes -- takes a great film and turns it into a mundane soap opera . 
+1 funny and , at times , poignant , the film from director george hickenlooper all takes place in pasadena , " a city where people still read . " 
-1 la de salma es una versión de frida superficial , preciosista y sin ningún contenido . 
-1 though frida is easier to swallow than julie taymor's preposterous titus , the eye candy here lacks considerable brio . 
+1 that the e-graveyard holds as many good ideas as bad is the cold comfort that chin's film serves up with style and empathy . 
-1 stirs potentially enticing ingredients into an uneasy blend of ghost and close encounters of the third kind . 
+1 it's absolutely spooky how lillard channels the shagster right down to the original casey kasem-furnished voice . 
+1 see it now , before the inevitable hollywood remake flattens out all its odd , intriguing wrinkles . 
-1 feels less like it's about teenagers , than it was written by teenagers . 
-1 the entire movie is filled with deja vu moments . 
-1 a bit of an unwieldy mess . 
+1 a subtle , poignant picture of goodness that is flawed , compromised and sad . 
-1 plays like one long , meandering sketch inspired by the works of john waters and todd solondz , rather than a fully developed story . 
-1 call me a cynic , but there's something awfully deadly about any movie with a life-affirming message . 
+1 'almodóvar logra un filme entrañable , lleno de compasión , comprensión , amor , amistad , esperanza y humanidad que es sencillamente inolvidable . '
-1 comes across as a fairly weak retooling . 
-1 some of it is clever , but it is never melodic/
-1 it may play well as a double feature with mainstream foreign mush like my big fat greek wedding
-1 it's fun , but a psychological mess , with austin powers bumping his head on the way out of the closet . 
+1 montias . . . pumps a lot of energy into his nicely nuanced narrative and surrounds himself with a cast of quirky -- but not stereotyped -- street characters . 
+1 jackson tries to keep the plates spinning as best he can , but all the bouncing back and forth can't help but become a bit tedious -- even with the breathtaking landscapes and villainous varmints there to distract you from the ricocheting . 
-1 as elegantly crafted as it often is , anderson's movie is essentially a one-trick pony that , hampered by an undeveloped script , ultimately pulls up lame . 
-1 twenty-three movies into a mostly magnificent directorial career , clint eastwood's efficiently minimalist style finally has failed him . big time . 
-1 it's provocative stuff , but the speculative effort is hampered by taylor's cartoonish performance and the film's ill-considered notion that hitler's destiny was shaped by the most random of chances . 
-1 amid the cliché and foreshadowing , cage manages a degree of casual realism . . . that is routinely dynamited by blethyn . 
-1 gee , a second assassin shot kennedy ? moot point . 
+1 a canny , derivative , wildly gruesome portrait of a london sociopath who's the scariest of sadists . 
+1 we can see the wheels turning , and we might resent it sometimes , but this is still a nice little picture , made by bright and friendly souls with a lot of good cheer . 
+1 despite its old-hat set-up and predictable plot , empire still has enough moments to keep it entertaining . 
-1 it's slow -- very , very slow . it's not the ultimate depression-era gangster movie . that's pure pr hype . 
+1 in its dry and forceful way , it delivers the same message as jiri menzel's closely watched trains and danis tanovic's no man's land . 
+1 eric schweig and graham greene both exude an air of dignity that's perfect for the proud warrior that still lingers in the souls of these characters . 
+1 a small gem of a movie that defies classification and is as thought-provoking as it is funny , scary and sad . 
-1 as a hybrid teen thriller and murder mystery , murder by numbers fits the profile too closely . 
+1 a biopic about crane's life in the classic tradition but evolves into what has become of us all in the era of video . 
+1 the attraction between these two marginal characters is complex from the start -- and , refreshingly , stays that way . 
+1 will you go ape over this movie ? well , it probably won't have you swinging from the trees hooting it's praises , but it's definitely worth taking a look . 
+1 a charming , quirky and leisurely paced scottish comedy -- except with an outrageous central gimmick that could have been a reject from monty python's meaning of life . 
+1 viveka seldahl and sven wollter will touch you to the core in a film you will never forget -- that you should never forget . 
-1 something has been lost in the translation . . . another routine hollywood frightfest in which the slack execution italicizes the absurdity of the premise . 
-1 serry does a fine job of capturing the climate of the times and , perhaps unwittingly , relating it to what is happening in america in 2002 . but hard-to-believe plot twists force the movie off track in its final half hour . 
+1 like its bizarre heroine , it irrigates our souls . 
+1 richly entertaining and suggestive of any number of metaphorical readings . 
-1 one groan-inducing familiarity begets another . 
+1 even if you have no interest in the gang-infested , east-vs . -west coast rap wars , this modern mob music drama never fails to fascinate . 
+1 my wife is an actress works as well as it does because [the leads] are such a companionable couple . 
-1 equal parts bodice-ripper and plodding costume drama . 
-1 this is no " waterboy ! " 
+1 sensual , funny and , in the end , very touching . 
+1 the film is painfully authentic , and the performances of the young players are utterly convincing . 
-1 the marquis de sade couldn't have been as dull a person as this film makes him out to be . 
-1 the filmmakers juggle and juxtapose three story lines but fail to come up with one cogent point , unless it's that life stinks , especially for sensitive married women who really love other women . 
-1 it almost feels as if the movie is more interested in entertaining itself than in amusing us . 
+1 not for the prurient or squeamish , it's a daring if overlong examination of an idolized culture , self-loathing and sexual politics . 
-1 there ain't a lot more painful than an unfunny movie that thinks it's hilarious . 
+1 the bourne identity shouldn't be half as entertaining as it is , but director doug liman and his colleagues have managed to pack it with enough action to satisfy the boom-bam crowd without a huge sacrifice of character and mood . 
-1 watching trouble every day , at least if you don't know what's coming , is like biting into what looks like a juicy , delicious plum on a hot summer day and coming away with your mouth full of rotten pulp and living worms . 
+1 the warm presence of zhao benshan makes the preposterous lying hero into something more than he reasonably should be . 
-1 enough trivializes an important crisis , reduces it to an almost comic embarrassment . 
-1 a fast-paced , glitzy but extremely silly piece . 
+1 bittersweet comedy/drama full of life , hand gestures , and some really adorable italian guys . 
+1 missteps take what was otherwise a fascinating , riveting story and send it down the path of the mundane . 
+1 a brilliant gag at the expense of those who paid for it and those who pay to see it . 
+1 lee jeong-hyang tells it so lovingly and films it so beautifully that i couldn't help being captivated by it . 
-1 elicits more groans from the audience than jar jar binks , scrappy doo and scooby dumb , all wrapped up into one . 
-1 a journey that's too random and inconclusive to be compelling , but which hoffman's brilliance almost makes worth taking . 
+1 time changer may not be the most memorable cinema session but its profound self-evaluation message about our fragile existence and the absence of spiritual guidance should at least invade an abundance of mindsets
-1  . . . turns so unforgivably trite in its last 10 minutes that anyone without a fortified sweet tooth will likely go into sugar shock . 
-1 a synthesis of cliches and absurdities that seems positively decadent in its cinematic flash and emptiness . 
+1 gloriously goofy ( and gory ) midnight movie stuff . 
-1  . . . comes alive only when it switches gears to the sentimental . 
+1 [f]rom the performances and the cinematography to the outstanding soundtrack and unconventional narrative , the film is blazingly alive and admirable on many levels . 
+1 if it tried to do anything more , it would fail and perhaps explode , but at this level of manic whimsy , it is just about right . 
-1 i have to admit i walked out of runteldat . i did go back and check out the last 10 minutes , but these were more repulsive than the first 30 or 40 minutes . 
+1 arteta paints a picture of lives lived in a state of quiet desperation . 
-1 the transporter bombards the viewer with so many explosions and side snap kicks that it ends up being surprisingly dull . 
-1 an incredibly narrow in-joke targeted to the tiniest segment of an already obscure demographic . 
+1 a vivid cinematic portrait . 
+1 a thought-provoking picture . 
-1 just another disjointed , fairly predictable psychological thriller . 
+1 as if to prove a female director can make a movie with no soft edges , kathryn bigelow offers no sugar-coating or interludes of lightness . her film is unrelentingly claustrophobic and unpleasant . 
+1 really is a pan-american movie , with moments of genuine insight into the urban heart . 
+1 the beauty of the piece is that it counts heart as important as humor . 
+1 reno himself can take credit for most of the movie's success . he's one of the few 'cool' actors who never seems aware of his own coolness . 
-1 i don't think i laughed out loud once . and when you're talking about a slapstick comedy , that's a pretty big problem . 
+1 a moving and weighty depiction of one family's attempts to heal after the death of a child . 
+1 with youthful high spirits , tautou remains captivating throughout michele's religious and romantic quests , and she is backed by a likable cast . 
+1 girls gone wild and gone civil again
-1 one of the most plain , unimaginative romantic comedies i've ever seen . 
+1 illuminating if overly talky documentary . 
+1  . . . begins on a high note and sustains it beautifully . 
+1 provides the kind of 'laugh therapy' i need from movie comedies -- offbeat humor , amusing characters , and a happy ending . after seeing 'analyze that , ' i feel better already . 
-1 while this film has an 'a' list cast and some strong supporting players , the tale -- like its central figure , vivi -- is just a little bit hard to love . 
-1 the director mostly plays it straight , turning leys' fable into a listless climb down the social ladder . 
-1 this overproduced piece of dreck is shockingly bad and absolutely unnecessary . hmmmmight i suggest that the wayward wooden one end it all by stuffing himself into an electric pencil sharpener ? 
+1 [gulpilil] is a commanding screen presence , and his character's abundant humanism makes him the film's moral compass . 
+1 tsai ming-liang has taken his trademark style and refined it to a crystalline point . 
-1 like those to rome , all roads in the banger sisters inevitably lead to a joke about hawn's breasts , which constantly threaten to upstage the woman sporting them . 
-1 like all abstract art , the film does not make this statement in an easily accessible way , and -- unless prewarned -- it would be very possible for a reasonably intelligent person to sit through its tidal wave of imagery and not get this vision at all .

+1 immersing us in the endlessly inventive , fiercely competitive world of hip-hop djs , the project is sensational and revelatory , even if scratching makes you itch .

-1 though certainly original in form , altar boys requires a taste for swamp thing-type animation , doubled with a deafening score . 
-1 slackers' jokey approach to college education is disappointingly simplistic -- the film's biggest problem -- and there are no unforgettably stupid stunts or uproariously rude lines of dialogue to remember it by .

-1 it sounds like another clever if pointless excursion into the abyss , and that's more or less how it plays out .
