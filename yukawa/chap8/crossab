-1 for all its highfalutin title and corkscrew narrative , the movie turns out to be not much more than a shaggy human tale . 
+1 the hook is the drama within the drama , as an unsolved murder and an unresolved moral conflict jockey for the spotlight . 
+1 lasker's canny , meditative script distances sex and love , as byron and luther . . . realize they can't get no satisfaction without the latter . 
+1 beautifully observed , miraculously unsentimental comedy-drama . 
+1 the film's images give a backbone to the company and provide an emotional edge to its ultimate demise . 
-1 a movie far more cynical and lazy than anything a fictitious charlie kaufman might object to . 
+1 its spirit of iconoclastic abandon -- however canned -- makes for unexpectedly giddy viewing . 
+1 this horror-comedy doesn't go for the usual obvious laughs at the expense of cheap-looking monsters -- unless you count elvira's hooters . 
-1 a mediocre exercise in target demographics , unaware that it's the butt of its own joke . 
-1 it can't decide if it wants to be a mystery/thriller , a romance or a comedy . 
-1 almost everything about the film is unsettling , from the preposterous hairpiece worn by lai's villainous father to the endless action sequences . 
-1 it's badly acted , blandly directed , and could have been scripted by someone who just graduated from elementary school . 
-1 generic thriller junk . teens only . 
-1 ends up offering nothing more than the latest schwarzenegger or stallone flick would . 
+1 about nowhere kids who appropriated turfs as they found them and become self-made celebrity athletes -- a low-down version of the american dream . 
-1  . . . a preachy parable stylized with a touch of john woo bullet ballet . 
+1 the movie occasionally threatens to become didactic , but it's too grounded in the reality of its characters to go over the edge . a touch of humor or an unexpected plot twist always pulls it back . 
-1 i hate this movie
+1 an escapist confection that's pure entertainment . 
-1 the action is reasonably well-done . . . yet story , character and comedy bits are too ragged to ever fit smoothly together . 
+1 this is a shrewd and effective film from a director who understands how to create and sustain a mood . 
-1 nothing about it fits . 
-1 now here's a sadistic bike flick that would have made vittorio de sica proud . 
+1 the film is visually dazzling , the depicted events dramatic , funny and poignant . 
+1 with notorious c . h . o . cho proves she has the stuff to stand tall with pryor , carlin and murphy . 
-1 as the latest bid in the tv-to-movie franchise game , i spy makes its big-screen entry with little of the nervy originality of its groundbreaking small-screen progenitor . 
-1 it won't be long before you'll spy i spy at a video store near you . 
+1 a very pretty after-school special . it's an effort to watch this movie , but it eventually pays off and is effective if you stick with it . 
-1 what could and should have been biting and droll is instead a tepid waste of time and talent . 
-1 there's not a single jump-in-your-seat moment and believe it or not , jason actually takes a backseat in his own film to special effects . 
+1 a fine , rousing , g-rated family film , aimed mainly at little kids but with plenty of entertainment value to keep grown-ups from squirming in their seats . 
-1 despite its visual virtuosity , 'naqoyqatsi' is banal in its message and the choice of material to convey it . 
-1 worthy of the gong . 
-1 what is 100% missing here is a script of even the most elemental literacy , an inkling of genuine wit , and anything resembling acting . 
+1 famuyiwa's feature deals with its subject matter in a tasteful , intelligent manner , rather than forcing us to endure every plot contrivance that the clich√©-riddled genre can offer . 
+1 giggling at the absurdities and inconsistencies is part of the fun . but the talented cast alone will keep you watching , as will the fight scenes . 
+1 an effective portrait of a life in stasis -- of the power of inertia to arrest development in a dead-end existence . 
+1 a breezy romantic comedy that has the punch of a good sitcom , while offering exceptionally well-detailed characters . 
-1 it was a dark and stormy night . . . 
+1 the year's happiest surprise , a movie that deals with a real subject in an always surprising way . 
+1 the movie starts with a legend and ends with a story that is so far-fetched it would be impossible to believe if it weren't true . this is the stuff that disney movies are made of . 
+1 the movie understands like few others how the depth and breadth of emotional intimacy give the physical act all of its meaning and most of its pleasure . 
+1 combine the paranoid claustrophobia of a submarine movie with the unsettling spookiness of the supernatural -- why didn't hollywood think of this sooner ? 
+1 fast , frantic and fun , but also soon forgotten
-1 this u-boat doesn't have a captain . 
-1 how about starting with a more original story instead of just slapping extreme humor and gross-out gags on top of the same old crap ? 
-1 it does nothing new with the old story , except to show fisticuffs in this sort of stop-go slow motion that makes the gang rumbles look like they're being streamed over a 28k modem . 
+1 a gem , captured in the unhurried , low-key style favored by many directors of the iranian new wave . 
-1 does paint some memorable images . . . , but makhmalbaf keeps her distance from the characters
-1 another big , dumb action movie in the vein of xxx , the transporter is riddled with plot holes big enough for its titular hero to drive his sleek black bmw through . 
-1 the emperor's club is one of those films that possesses all the good intentions in the world , but . . . 
-1 certain to be distasteful to children and adults alike , eight crazy nights is a total misfire . 
-1 another in-your-face wallow in the lower depths made by people who have never sung those blues . 
+1 from the opening strains of the average white band's " pick up the pieces " , you can feel the love . 
-1 the problem is not that it's all derivative , because plenty of funny movies recycle old tropes . the problem is that van wilder does little that is actually funny with the material . 
-1 my precious new star wars movie is a lumbering , wheezy drag . . . 
+1 a decided lack of spontaneity in its execution and a dearth of real poignancy in its epiphanies . 
+1 the performances are an absolute joy . 
-1 if you're looking for comedy to be served up , better look elsewhere . 
+1 that storytelling has value cannot be denied . not even solondz's thirst for controversy , sketchy characters and immature provocations can fully succeed at cheapening it . 
+1 the first shocking thing about sorority boys is that it's actually watchable . even more baffling is that it's funny . 
+1 these three films form a remarkably cohesive whole , both visually and thematically , through their consistently sensitive and often exciting treatment of an ignored people . 
+1 brian tufano's handsome widescreen photography and paul grabowsky's excellent music turn this fairly parochial melodrama into something really rather special . 
-1 the direction occasionally rises to the level of marginal competence , but for most of the film it is hard to tell who is chasing who or why . 
+1 a tender , witty , captivating film about friendship , love , memory , trust and loyalty . 
-1 one thing is for sure : this movie does not tell you a whole lot about lily chou-chou . 
-1 a turgid little history lesson , humourless and dull . 
+1 the direction has a fluid , no-nonsense authority , and the performances by harris , phifer and cam'ron seal the deal . 
+1 a mostly believable , refreshingly low-key and quietly inspirational little sports drama . 
-1 the big-screen scooby makes the silly original cartoon seem smart and well-crafted in comparison . 
-1 muddled , trashy and incompetent
+1 interacting eyeball-to-eyeball and toe-to-toe , hopkins and norton are a winning combination -- but fiennes steals 'red dragon' right from under their noses . 
+1 i am not generally a huge fan of cartoons derived from tv shows , but hey arnold ! the movie is clever , offbeat and even gritty enough to overcome my resistance . 
+1 [grant's] bumbling magic takes over the film , and it turns out to be another winning star vehicle . 
+1 the appearance of treebeard and gollum's expanded role will either have you loving what you're seeing , or rolling your eyes . i loved it ! gollum's 'performance' is incredible ! 
-1 hardly a nuanced portrait of a young woman's breakdown , the film nevertheless works up a few scares . 
+1 a journey spanning nearly three decades of bittersweet camaraderie and history , in which we feel that we truly know what makes holly and marina tick , and our hearts go out to them as both continue to negotiate their imperfect , love-hate relationship . 
+1 jones . . . makes a great impression as the writer-director of this little $1 . 8 million charmer , which may not be cutting-edge indie filmmaking but has a huge heart . 
-1 a lack of thesis makes maryam , in the end , play out with the intellectual and emotional impact of an after-school special . 
+1 although life or something like it is very much in the mold of feel-good movies , the cast and director stephen herek's polished direction pour delightfully piquant wine from aged bottles . 
-1 a static and sugary little half-hour , after-school special about interfaith understanding , stretched out to 90 minutes . 
+1 a delicious and delicately funny look at the residents of a copenhagen neighborhood coping with the befuddling complications life tosses at them . 
-1 best described as i know what you did last winter . 
+1 an edgy thriller that delivers a surprising punch . 
+1 the last kiss will probably never achieve the popularity of my big fat greek wedding , but its provocative central wedding sequence has far more impact . 
+1 proves a servicable world war ii drama that can't totally hide its contrivances , but it at least calls attention to a problem hollywood too long has ignored . 
-1 if sinise's character had a brain his ordeal would be over in five minutes but instead the plot goes out of its way to introduce obstacles for him to stumble over . 
+1 it is different from others in its genre in that it is does not rely on dumb gags , anatomical humor , or character cliches ; it primarily relies on character to tell its story . 
+1 combines a comically dismal social realism with a farcically bawdy fantasy of redemption and regeneration . 
+1 drumline ably captures the complicated relationships in a marching band . 
+1 birthday girl lucks out with chaplin and kidman , who are capable of anteing up some movie star charisma when they need it to sell us on this twisted love story , but who can also negotiate the movie's darker turns . 
+1 it is ridiculous , of course . . . but it is also refreshing , disarming , and just outright enjoyable despite its ridiculousness . 
+1 the entire movie has a truncated feeling , but what's available is lovely and lovable . 
+1 muccino , who directed from his own screenplay , is a canny crowd pleaser , and the last kiss . . . provides more than enough sentimental catharsis for a satisfying evening at the multiplex . 
+1 there is something that is so meditative and lyrical about babak payami's boldly quirky iranian drama secret ballot . . . a charming and evoking little ditty that manages to show the gentle and humane side of middle eastern world politics
-1 a mechanical action-comedy whose seeming purpose is to market the charismatic jackie chan to even younger audiences . 
+1 tsai ming-liang's ghosts are painfully aware of their not-being . 
-1  . . . its stupidities wind up sticking in one's mind a lot more than the cool bits . 
+1 a thoughtful and surprisingly affecting portrait of a screwed-up man who dared to mess with some powerful people , seen through the eyes of the idealistic kid who chooses to champion his ultimately losing cause . 
-1 one of those decades-spanning historical epics that strives to be intimate and socially encompassing but fails to do justice to either effort in three hours of screen time . 
-1 the dose is strong and funny , for the first 15 minutes anyway ; after that , the potency wanes dramatically . 
+1 beautifully reclaiming the story of carmen and recreating it an in an african idiom . 
-1 this is a truly , truly bad movie . 
-1 ultimately the , yes , snail-like pacing and lack of thematic resonance make the film more silly than scary , like some sort of martha stewart decorating program run amok . 
-1 what might have been acceptable on the printed page of iles' book does not translate well to the screen . 
+1 surprisingly powerful and universal . 
+1 audacious-impossible yet compelling . . . 
-1 has a long and clunky ending . . . which forces the audience to fidget through ten pseudo-serious minutes while waiting for the ending credits and the deleted scenes montage to break the audience's awkward silence
+1 after watching it , you can only love the players it brings to the fore for the gifted but no-nonsense human beings they are and for the still-inestimable contribution they have made to our shared history . 
+1 it turns out to be smarter and more diabolical than you could have guessed at the beginning . 
-1 who needs love like this ? 
+1 in the disturbingly involving family dysfunctional drama how i killed my father , french director anne fontaine delivers an inspired portrait of male-ridden angst and the emotional blockage that accompanies this human condition
+1 spider-man is about growing strange hairs , getting a more mature body , and finding it necessary to hide new secretions from the parental units . 
+1 light-years ahead of paint-by-number american blockbusters like pearl harbor , at least artistically . 
+1 an odd drama set in the world of lingerie models and bar dancers in the midwest that held my interest precisely because it didn't try to . 
-1 the movie's plot is almost entirely witless and inane , carrying every gag two or three times beyond its limit to sustain a laugh . 
+1 it's a clear-eyed portrait of an intensely lived time , filled with nervous energy , moral ambiguity and great uncertainties . 
-1 we get light showers of emotion a couple of times , but then -- strangely -- these wane to an inconsistent and ultimately unsatisfying drizzle . 
+1 what a bewilderingly brilliant and entertaining movie this is . 
-1 affleck merely creates an outline for a role he still needs to grow into , a role that ford effortlessly filled with authority . 
+1 it's immensely ambitious , different than anything that's been done before and amazingly successful in terms of what it's trying to do . 
-1 when a movie asks you to feel sorry for mick jagger's sex life , it already has one strike against it . 
-1 the enormous comic potential of an oafish idiot impersonating an aristocrat remains sadly unrealized . 
+1 a surprisingly charming and even witty match for the best of hollywood's comic-book adaptations . 
+1 colorful , energetic and sweetly whimsical . . . the rare sequel that's better than its predecessor . 
-1 little is done to support the premise other than fling gags at it to see which ones shtick . 
-1 made with no discernible craft and monstrously sanctimonious in dealing with childhood loss . 
-1 the film doesn't show enough of the creative process or even of what was created for the non-fan to figure out what makes wilco a big deal . 
-1 while the material is slight , the movie is better than you might think . 
-1 an uninspired preachy and clich√©d war film . 
-1 it's not hateful . it's simply stupid , irrelevant and deeply , truly , bottomlessly cynical . 
-1 indifferently implausible popcorn programmer of a movie . 
-1 kung pow is oedekerk's realization of his childhood dream to be in a martial-arts flick , and proves that sometimes the dreams of youth should remain just that . 
+1 hits one out of the park for the 'they don't make 'em like that anymore' department . 
+1 intelligent and moving . 
-1 potty-mouthed enough for pg-13 , yet not as hilariously raunchy as south park , this strangely schizo cartoon seems suited neither to kids or adults . 
+1 it's a humble effort , but spiced with wry humor and genuine pathos , especially between morgan and redgrave . 
-1 the skirmishes for power waged among victims and predators settle into an undistinguished rhythm of artificial suspense . 
-1 this stuck pig of a movie flails limply between bizarre comedy and pallid horror . 
-1 the film is flat . 
+1 i am highly amused by the idea that we have come to a point in society where it has been deemed important enough to make a film in which someone has to be hired to portray richard dawson . 
+1 a tasty masala . 
-1  . . . hokey art house pretension . 
-1 makes for a pretty unpleasant viewing experience . 
-1 sometimes makes less sense than the bruckheimeresque american action flicks it emulates . 
+1 an elegant work , food of love is as consistently engaging as it is revealing . 
+1 the acting , costumes , music , cinematography and sound are all astounding given the production's austere locales . 
+1 with rabbit-proof fence , noyce has tailored an epic tale into a lean , economical movie . 
-1 too daft by half . . . but supremely good natured . 
+1 the film gets close to the chimps the same way goodall did , with a serious minded patience , respect and affection . 
-1 overburdened with complicated plotting and banal dialogue
+1 the film brilliantly shines on all the characters , as the direction is intelligently accomplished . 
+1 o √öltimo suspeito ganha for√ßa ao tamb√©m funcionar em uma esfera adicional : a do drama familiar . 
-1 there are things to like about murder by numbers -- but , in the end , the disparate elements don't gel . 
-1 to be influenced chiefly by humanity's greatest shame , reality shows -- reality shows for god's sake ! -- is a crime that should be punishable by chainsaw . 
-1 the people in abc africa are treated as docile , mostly wordless ethnographic extras . 
-1 the rock has a great presence but one battle after another is not the same as one battle followed by killer cgi effects . 
-1 competently directed but terminally cute drama . 
+1 with its hint of an awkward hitchcockian theme in tact , harmon's daunting narrative promotes a reasonable landscape of conflict and pathos to support the scattershot terrorizing tone
+1 a marvel of production design . 
-1 the new film of anton chekhov's the cherry orchard puts the 'ick' in 'classic . '
+1 this filmed tosca -- not the first , by the way -- is a pretty good job , if it's filmed tosca that you want . i'll stay with the stage versions , however , which bite cleaner , and deeper . 
+1 subversive , meditative , clinical and poetic , the piano teacher is a daring work of genius . 
-1 [two] fairly dull -- contrasting and interlocking stories about miserable scandinavian settlers in 18th-century canada , and yuppie sailboaters in the here and now . 
+1 the level of acting elevates the material above pat inspirational status and gives it a sturdiness and solidity that we've long associated with washington the actor . 
+1 it deserves to be seen by anyone with even a passing interest in the events shaping the world beyond their own horizons . 
+1 until its final minutes this is a perceptive study of two families in crisis -- and of two girls whose friendship is severely tested by bad luck and their own immaturity . 
-1 without the dark spookiness of crystal lake camp , the horror concept completely loses its creepy menace . 
-1 a sudsy cautionary tale . 
+1 it's endearing to hear madame d . refer to her husband as 'jackie' -- and he does make for excellent company , not least as a self-conscious performer . 
+1 stands as one of the year's most intriguing movie experiences , letting its imagery speak for it while it forces you to ponder anew what a movie can be . 
-1 so devoid of any kind of intelligible story that it makes films like xxx and collateral damage seem like thoughtful treatises
-1 [director] o'fallon manages to put some lovely pictures up on the big screen , but his skill at telling a story -- he also contributed to the screenplay -- falls short . 
+1 clever and unflinching in its comic barbs , slap her is a small but rewarding comedy that takes aim at contemporary southern adolescence and never lets up . 
-1 i've had more interesting -- and , dare i say , thematically complex -- bowel movements than this long-on-the-shelf , point-and-shoot exercise in gimmicky crime drama . 
-1 as is most commonly case with projects such noble and lofty ambitions , the film is less poetic than simply pretentious . 
+1 despite its flaws , secretary stays in your head and makes you question your own firmly held positions . 
-1 it's dull , spiritless , silly and monotonous : an ultra-loud blast of pointless mayhem , going nowhere fast . 
+1  " mr . deeds " is suitable summer entertainment that offers escapism without requiring a great deal of thought . 
+1 though it never rises to its full potential as a film , still offers a great deal of insight into the female condition and the timeless danger of emotions repressed . 
-1 an ultra-low-budget indie debut that smacks more of good intentions than talent . 
+1 pretty good little movie . 
-1 the characters , cast in impossibly contrived situations , are totally estranged from reality . 
-1 a free-for-all of half-baked thoughts , clumsily used visual tricks and self-indulgent actor moments . 
+1 blessed with two fine , nuanced lead performances . 
+1 if the film has a problem , its shortness disappoints : you want the story to go on and on . 
+1 what a concept , what an idea , what a thrill ride . this is a more fascinating look at the future than " bladerunner " and one of the most high-concept sci fi adventures attempted for the screen . 
+1 the ya-ya's have many secrets and one is - the books are better . translating complex characters from novels to the big screen is an impossible task but they are true to the essence of what it is to be ya-ya . 
-1 starts out with tremendous promise , introducing an intriguing and alluring premise , only to fall prey to a boatload of screenwriting cliches that sink it faster than a leaky freighter . 
-1 blessed with immense physical prowess he may well be , but ahola is simply not an actor . and in truth , cruel as it may sound , he makes arnold schwarzenegger look like spencer tracy . 
+1 a surprisingly 'solid' achievement by director malcolm d . lee and writer john ridley . 
-1 shame on writer/director vicente aranda for making a florid biopic about mad queens , obsessive relationships , and rampant adultery so dull . 
-1 cheap , vulgar dialogue and a plot that crawls along at a snail's pace . 
+1 sexy and romantic . 
+1 a study in shades of gray , offering itself up in subtle plot maneuvers . . . 
+1 it'll keep you wide awake and . . . very tense . 
-1 so stupid , so ill-conceived , so badly drawn , it created whole new levels of ugly . 
+1 you'll get the enjoyable basic minimum . but not a whit more . 
-1 the satire is unfocused , while the story goes nowhere . 
-1 de niro looks bored , murphy recycles murphy , and you mentally add showtime to the pile of hollywood dreck that represents nothing more than the art of the deal . 
+1 this is a movie that refreshes the mind and spirit along with the body , so original is its content , look , and style . 
+1 while mcfarlane's animation lifts the film firmly above the level of other coming-of-age films . . . it's also so jarring that it's hard to get back into the boys' story . 
+1 it's so good that you can practically see the hollywood 'suits' trying to put together the cast and filmmaking team for the all-too -inevitable american remake . 
-1 a broad , melodramatic estrogen opera that's pretty toxic in its own right . 
+1 move over bond ; this girl deserves a sequel . 
-1 it all seemed wasted like deniro's once promising career and the once grand long beach boardwalk . 
-1 nothing here seems as funny as it did in analyze this , not even joe viterelli as de niro's right-hand goombah . 
+1 if you thought tom hanks was just an ordinary big-screen star , wait until you've seen him eight stories tall . 
-1 the x potion gives the quickly named blossom , bubbles and buttercup supernatural powers that include extraordinary strength and laser-beam eyes , which unfortunately don't enable them to discern flimsy screenplays . 
+1 if you can push on through the slow spots , you'll be rewarded with some fine acting . 
-1  " i blame all men for war , " [the warden's daughter] tells her father . the movie is about as deep as that sentiment . 
+1 more intimate than spectacular , e . t . is carried less by wow factors than by its funny , moving yarn that holds up well after two decades . 
+1 chicago is , in many ways , an admirable achievement . 
+1 culkin , who's in virtually every scene , shines as a young man who uses sarcastic lies like a shield . 
-1 too restrained to be a freak show , too mercenary and obvious to be cerebral , too dull and pretentious to be engaging . . . the isle defies an easy categorization . 
-1 the bland outweighs the nifty , and cletis tout never becomes the clever crime comedy it thinks it is . 
+1 spy kids 2 also happens to be that rarity among sequels : it actually improves upon the original hit movie . 
+1 ¬Öan adorably whimsical comedy that deserves more than a passing twinkle . 
-1 apparently kissing leads to suicide attempts and tragic deaths . marisa tomei is good , but just a kiss is just a mess . 
+1 while the film is not entirely successful , it still manages to string together enough charming moments to work . 
+1 this one is not nearly as dreadful as expected . in fact , it's quite fun in places . 
+1 an inventive , absorbing movie that's as hard to classify as it is hard to resist . 
-1 the uneven movie does have its charms and its funny moments but not quite enough of them . 
-1 a semi-autobiographical film that's so sloppily written and cast that you cannot believe anyone more central to the creation of bugsy than the caterer had anything to do with it . 
-1 i'm not saying that ice age doesn't have some fairly pretty pictures , but there's not enough substance in the story to actually give them life . 
+1 star/producer salma hayek and director julie taymor have infused frida with a visual style unique and inherent to the titular character's paintings and in the process created a masterful work of art of their own . 
-1 since dahmer resorts to standard slasher flick thrills when it should be most in the mind of the killer , it misses a major opportunity to be truly revelatory about his psyche . 
-1 falls short in explaining the music and its roots . 
-1  . . . a pretentious and ultimately empty examination of a sick and evil woman . 
-1 the overall effect is so completely inane that one would have to be mighty bored to even think of staying with this for more than , say , ten . . . make that three minutes . 
+1 the film's greatest asset is how much it's not just another connect-the-dots , spy-on-the-run picture . 
+1 fessenden's narrative is just as much about the ownership and redefinition of myth as it is about a domestic unit finding their way to joy . 
+1 strip it of all its excess debris , and you'd have a 90-minute , four-star movie . as it is , it's too long and unfocused . 
-1 a by-the-numbers patient/doctor pic that covers all the usual ground
-1 a film that plays things so nice 'n safe as to often play like a milquetoast movie of the week blown up for the big screen . 
+1 to honestly address the flaws inherent in how medical aid is made available to american workers , a more balanced or fair portrayal of both sides will be needed . 
+1 charlotte sometimes is a brilliant movie . it is about irrational , unexplainable life and it seems so real because it does not attempt to filter out the complexity . 
-1 there is only so much baked cardboard i need to chew . 
-1 if melville is creatively a great whale , this film is canned tuna . 
-1 i'm sure the filmmakers found this a remarkable and novel concept , but anybody who has ever seen an independent film can report that it is instead a cheap clich√© . 
+1 an impeccable study in perversity . 
-1 earnest falls short of its ideal predecessor largely due to parker's ill-advised meddling with the timeless source material . 
-1 the bottom line , at least in my opinion , is imposter makes a better short story than it does a film . 
+1 the filmmaker's heart is in the right place . . . 
+1 you have enough finely tuned acting to compensate for the movie's failings . 
-1 when seagal appeared in an orange prison jumpsuit , i wanted to stand up in the theater and shout , 'hey , kool-aid ! '
+1 genuinely touching because it's realistic about all kinds of love . 
-1 one well-timed explosion in a movie can be a knockout , but a hundred of them can be numbing . proof of this is ballistic : ecks vs . sever . 
-1 even when crush departs from the 4w formula . . . it feels like a glossy rehash . 
+1 corny , schmaltzy and predictable , but still manages to be kind of heartwarming , nonetheless . it's the perfect kind of film to see when you don't want to use your brain . at all . 
-1 see clockstoppers if you have nothing better to do with 94 minutes . but be warned , you too may feel time has decided to stand still . or that the battery on your watch has died . 
-1 the logic of it all will be greek to anyone not predisposed to the movie's rude and crude humor . 
+1 devos delivers a perfect performance that captures the innocence and budding demons within a wallflower . 
-1 i liked the movie , but i know i would have liked it more if it had just gone that one step further . i'm left slightly disappointed that it didn't . 
+1 the spark of special anime magic here is unmistakable and hard to resist . 
+1 there are problems with this film that even 3 oscar winners can't overcome , but it's a nice girl-buddy movie once it gets rock-n-rolling . 
-1 for all of the contemporary post-colonialist consciousness that kapur tries to bring to the four feathers , the oddest thing about the movie is how it winds up affirming the same damn moldy values the material has always held dear . 
+1 elling really is about a couple of crazy guys , and it's therapeutic to laugh along with them . 
-1 rosenthal ( halloween ii ) seems to have forgotten everything he ever knew about generating suspense . 
-1 this isn't even madonna's swept away . this is her blue lagoon . 
+1 lathan and diggs carry the film with their charisma , and both exhibit sharp comic timing that makes the more hackneyed elements of the film easier to digest . 
-1 the furious coherence that [deniro] brings to this part only underscores the fuzzy sentimentality of the movie itself , which feels , as it plods toward the end , less like a movie than like the filmed reading of a script in need of polishing . 
-1 blessed with a searing lead performance by ryan gosling ( murder by numbers ) , the movie is powerful and provocative . it's also built on a faulty premise , one it follows into melodrama and silliness . 
-1  . . . an hour-and-a-half of inoffensive , unmemorable filler . 
+1 the story is virtually impossible to follow here , but there's a certain style and wit to the dialogue . 
+1 highly recommended viewing for its courage , ideas , technical proficiency and great acting . 
+1 leigh is one of the rare directors who feels acting is the heart and soul of cinema . he allows his cast members to make creative contributions to the story and dialogue . this method almost never fails him , and it works superbly here . 
-1 for a film about action , ultimate x is the gabbiest giant-screen movie ever , bogging down in a barrage of hype . 
-1 never comes together as a coherent whole . 
-1 so exaggerated and broad that it comes off as annoying rather than charming . 
-1 shocking only in that it reveals the filmmaker's bottomless pit of self-absorption . 
-1 halfway through , however , having sucked dry the undead action flick formula , blade ii mutates into a gross-out monster movie with effects that are more silly than scary . 
+1 definitely funny stuff , but it's more of the 'laughing at' variety than the 'laughing with . '
+1 a big-budget/all-star movie as unblinkingly pure as the hours is a distinct rarity , and an event . 
-1 you have no affinity for most of the characters . nothing about them is attractive . what they see in each other also is difficult to fathom . 
+1 slight but enjoyable documentary . 
-1 it's another video movie photographed like a film , with the bad lighting that's often written off as indie film naturalism .

-1 this is the kind of movie that you only need to watch for about thirty seconds before you say to yourself , 'ah , yes , here we have a bad , bad , bad movie . '
-1 woo has as much right to make a huge action sequence as any director , but how long will filmmakers copy the " saving private ryan " battle scenes before realizing steven spielberg got it right the first time ?

-1 moderately involving despite bargain-basement photography and hackneyed romance . 
+1 the year 2002 has conjured up more coming-of-age stories than seem possible , but take care of my cat emerges as the very best of them . 
+1 it's a work by an artist so in control of both his medium and his message that he can improvise like a jazzman . 
-1 visually rather stunning , but ultimately a handsome-looking bore , the true creativity would have been to hide treasure planet entirely and completely reimagine it . 
-1 it's better than the phantom menace . but unless you're an absolute raving star wars junkie , it isn't much fun . 
-1 definitely in the guilty pleasure b-movie category , reign of fire is so incredibly inane that it is laughingly enjoyable . 
+1 no screen fantasy-adventure in recent memory has the showmanship of clones' last 45 minutes . 
-1 there's only one way to kill michael myers for good : stop buying tickets to these movies . 
+1 it's a much more emotional journey than what shyamalan has given us in his past two movies , and gibson , stepping in for bruce willis , is the perfect actor to take us on the trip . 
-1 completely awful iranian drama . . . as much fun as a grouchy ayatollah in a cold mosque . 
+1 evokes the frustration , the awkwardness and the euphoria of growing up , without relying on the usual tropes . 
+1 a wildly entertaining scan of evans' career . 
+1 more good than great but freeman and judd make it work . 
+1 this is one of the rarest kinds of films : a family-oriented non-disney film that is actually funny without hitting below the belt . 
+1 an operatic , sprawling picture that's entertainingly acted , magnificently shot and gripping enough to sustain most of its 170-minute length . 
-1 in the end , tuck everlasting falls victim to that everlasting conundrum experienced by every human who ever lived : too much to do , too little time to do it in .

+1 playfully profound . . . and crazier than michael jackson on the top floor of a skyscraper nursery surrounded by open windows . 
+1 as giddy and whimsical and relevant today as it was 270 years ago . 
-1 instead of panoramic sweep , kapur gives us episodic choppiness , undermining the story's emotional thrust . 
+1 an emotionally strong and politically potent piece of cinema . 
+1 the real star of this movie is the score , as in the songs translate well to film , and it's really well directed . 
+1 viewed on its own terms , treasure planet is better-than-average family entertainment , but true fans of the stevenson's novel will likely prefer disney's more faithful 1950 live-action swashbuckling classic . 
-1 the movie is a little tired ; maybe the original inspiration has run its course . 
+1 lacks the inspiration of the original and has a bloated plot that stretches the running time about 10 minutes past a child's interest and an adult's patience . but it also has many of the things that made the first one charming . 
+1 the film's sense of imagery gives it a terrible strength , but it's propelled by the acting . 
-1 romanek keeps adding flourishes -- artsy fantasy sequences -- that simply feel wrong . they cheapen the overall effect . 
+1 although jackson is doubtless reserving the darkest hours for the return of the king , we long for a greater sense of urgency in the here and now of the two towers . 
+1 [clooney's] debut can be accused of being a bit undisciplined , but it has a tremendous , offbeat sense of style and humor that suggests he was influenced by some of the filmmakers who have directed him , especially the coen brothers and steven soderbergh . 
+1 once you get into its rhythm . . . the movie becomes a heady experience . 
-1 [allen's] best works understand why snobbery is a better satiric target than middle-america diversions could ever be .

+1 has enough wit , energy and geniality to please not only the fanatical adherents on either side , but also people who know nothing about the subject and think they're not interested . 
+1 moore's complex and important film is also , believe it or not , immensely entertaining , a david and goliath story that's still very much playing itself out . 
+1 walter hill's undisputed is like a 1940s warner bros . b picture , and i mean that as a compliment .

-1  . . . delivers few moments of inspiration amid the bland animation and simplistic story . 
-1 for each chuckle there are at least 10 complete misses , many coming from the amazingly lifelike tara reid , whose acting skills are comparable to a cardboard cutout . 
-1 works hard to establish rounded characters , but then has nothing fresh or particularly interesting to say about them . 
-1 this is nothing but familiar territory . 
+1 has a certain ghoulish fascination , and generates a fair amount of b-movie excitement . 
+1 even before it builds up to its insanely staged ballroom scene , in which 3000 actors appear in full regalia , it's waltzed itself into the art film pantheon . 
+1 an earnest , roughshod document , it serves as a workable primer for the region's recent history , and would make a terrific 10th-grade learning tool .

+1 a moving and not infrequently breathtaking film . 
+1 fans of behan's work and of irish movies in general will be rewarded by borstal boy .

+1 told just proficiently enough to trounce its overly comfortable trappings . 
-1 tom green and an ivy league college should never appear together on a marquee , especially when the payoff is an unschooled comedy like stealing harvard , which fails to keep 80 minutes from seeming like 800 . 
+1 for movie lovers as well as opera lovers , tosca is a real treat . 
-1 ¬Ö is an arthritic attempt at directing by callie khouri . i had to look away - this was god awful .

+1  . . . a cute and sometimes side-splittingly funny blend of legally blonde and drop dead gorgeous , starring piper perabo in what could be her breakthrough role . 
+1 an interesting story with a pertinent ( cinematically unique ) message , told fairly well and scored to perfection , i found myself struggling to put my finger on that elusive " missing thing . " 
+1 the tasteful little revision works wonders , enhancing the cultural and economic subtext , bringing richer meaning to the story's morals .

+1 we know the plot's a little crazy , but it held my interest from start to finish .

-1 make no mistake , ivans xtc . is a mess . 
-1 comes off like a rejected abc afterschool special , freshened up by the dunce of a screenwriting 101 class . . . . designed to provide a mix of smiles and tears , " crossroads " instead provokes a handful of unintentional howlers and numerous yawns . 
-1 one-sided documentary offers simplistic explanations to a very complex situation . . . . stylistically , the movie is a disaster .

+1 a certain sexiness underlines even the dullest tangents . 
+1 to get at the root psychology of this film would require many sessions on the couch of dr . freud . 
-1 unsurprisingly , the way this all works out makes the women look more like stereotypical caretakers and moral teachers , instead of serious athletes .

+1 a sober and affecting chronicle of the leveling effect of loss . 
+1 one of the best movies of the year . 
+1 the locations go from stark desert to gorgeous beaches . the story plays out slowly , but the characters are intriguing and realistic . 
-1 a morose little soap opera about three vapid , insensitive people who take turns hurting each other . it's a feature-length adaptation of one of those " can this marriage be saved ? " columns from ladies home journal . . .

+1 holm does his sly , intricate magic , and iben hjelje is entirely appealing as pumpkin . 
+1 an amazing and incendiary movie that dives straight into the rough waters of contradiction . 
-1 places a slightly believable love triangle in a difficult-to-swallow setting , and then disappointingly moves the story into the realm of an improbable thriller .

+1 confessions is without a doubt a memorable directorial debut from king hunk . 
-1 however sincere it may be , the rising place never quite justifies its own existence . 
-1 the director knows how to apply textural gloss , but his portrait of sex-as-war is strictly sitcom . 
-1 memorable for a peculiar malaise that renders its tension flaccid and , by extension , its surprises limp and its resolutions ritual . 
-1 began life as a computer game , then morphed into a movie -- a bad one , of course . 
+1 raimi crafted a complicated hero who is a welcome relief from the usual two-dimensional offerings . 
+1 when a movie has stuck around for this long , you know there's something there . it's that good . 
+1 shiri is an action film that delivers on the promise of excitement , but it also has a strong dramatic and emotional pull that gradually sneaks up on the audience . 
+1 although it bangs a very cliched drum at times , this crowd-pleaser's fresh dialogue , energetic music , and good-natured spunk are often infectious . 
-1 obstacles are too easily overcome and there isn't much in the way of character development in the script . 
+1 a well-rounded tribute to a man whose achievements -- and complexities -- reached far beyond the end zone . 
-1 mctiernan's remake may be lighter on its feet -- the sober-minded original was as graceful as a tap-dancing rhino -- but it is just as boring and as obvious . 
-1 we never really feel involved with the story , as all of its ideas remain just that : abstract ideas . 
-1 disappointing in comparison to other recent war movies¬Öor any other john woo flick for that matter . 
+1 the dirty jokes provide the funniest moments in this oddly sweet comedy about jokester highway patrolmen . 
-1 as befits its title , this pg-13-rated piffle is ultimately as threatening as the snuggle fabric softener bear . 
-1 a dreary movie . 
-1  . . . will always be remembered for the 9-11 terrorist attacks . after seeing the film , i can tell you that there's no other reason why anyone should bother remembering it . 
+1 though the violence is far less sadistic than usual , the film is typical miike : fast , furious and full of off-the-cuff imaginative flourishes . 
-1 gorgeous to look at but insufferably tedious and turgid . . . a curiously constricted epic . 
-1 pc stability notwithstanding , the film suffers from a simplistic narrative and a pat , fairy-tale conclusion . 
-1 after all the big build-up , the payoff for the audience , as well as the characters , is messy , murky , unsatisfying . 
-1 the advantage of a postapocalyptic setting is that it can be made on the cheap . any rock pile will do for a set . reign of fire has the disadvantage of also looking cheap .

-1 these self-styled athletes have banged their brains into the ground so frequently and furiously , their capacity to explain themselves has gone the same way as their natural instinct for self-preservation .

+1 awesome work : ineffable , elusive , yet inexplicably powerful
+1 admirers of director abel ferrara may be relieved that his latest feature , r xmas , marks a modest if encouraging return to form . 
-1 it's not as awful as some of the recent hollywood trip tripe . . . but it's far from a groundbreaking endeavor . 
-1 since lee is a sentimentalist , the film is more worshipful than your random e ! true hollywood story . 
+1 the grey zone gives voice to a story that needs to be heard in the sea of holocaust movies . . . but the film suffers from its own difficulties . 
+1 nakata's technique is to imply terror by suggestion , rather than the overuse of special effects . 
-1 a family-friendly fantasy that ends up doing very little with its imaginative premise . 
+1 much as we might be interested in gratuitous sexualization , haneke has a different objective in mind--namely the implications of our craving for fake stimulation . 
-1 the actors pull out all the stops in nearly every scene , but to diminishing effect . the characters never change . 
+1 pumpkin takes an admirable look at the hypocrisy of political correctness , but it does so with such an uneven tone that you never know when humor ends and tragedy begins . 
-1 the boys' sparring , like the succession of blows dumped on guei , wears down the story's more cerebral , and likable , plot elements . 
-1 such an incomprehensible mess that it feels less like bad cinema than like being stuck in a dark pit having a nightmare about bad cinema . 
+1 an exhilarating experience . 
-1 though this saga would be terrific to read about , it is dicey screen material that only a genius should touch . 
+1 steers turns in a snappy screenplay that curls at the edges ; it's so clever you want to hate it . but he somehow pulls it off . 
+1 for all the dolorous trim , secretary is a genial romance that maintains a surprisingly buoyant tone throughout , notwithstanding some of the writers' sporadic dips into pop freudianism . 
+1 [has] an immediacy and an intimacy that sucks you in and dares you not to believe it's all true . 
+1 intriguing and beautiful film , but those of you who read the book are likely to be disappointed . 
-1 though it pretends to expose the life of male hustlers , it's exploitive without being insightful . 
+1 there's not much to fatale , outside of its stylish surprises . . . but that's ok . 
+1 despite besson's high-profile name being wasabi's big selling point , there is no doubt that krawczyk deserves a huge amount of the credit for the film's thoroughly winning tone . 
+1 the film is impressive for the sights and sounds of the wondrous beats the world has to offer . 
+1 in capturing the understated comedic agony of an ever-ruminating , genteel yet decadent aristocracy that can no longer pay its bills , the film could just as well be addressing the turn of the 20th century into the 21st . 
-1 quick : who wants to see a comedy about shoddy airport security ? 
-1 yes , 4ever is harmless in the extreme and it'll mute your kids for nearly 80 minutes , but why not just treat the little yard apes to the real deal and take them to spirited away ? 
-1 unlike trey parker , sandler doesn't understand that the idea of exploiting molestation for laughs is funny , not actually exploiting it yourself . 
+1 smart , sassy interpretation of the oscar wilde play . 
-1 never having seen the first two films in the series , i can't compare friday after next to them , but nothing would change the fact that what we have here is a load of clams left in the broiling sun for a good three days . 
+1 a haunting tale of murder and mayhem . 
-1 while it's nice to watch a movie that hasn't been focus-grouped into tedium , yu's cinematic alchemy produces nearly as much lead as gold . 
-1 the threat implied in the title pok√©mon 4ever is terrifying ¬ñ like locusts in a horde these things will keep coming . 
-1 oversexed , at times overwrought comedy/drama that offers little insight into the experience of being forty , female and single . 
-1 the characters are paper thin and the plot is so cliched and contrived that it makes your least favorite james bond movie seem as cleverly plotted as the usual suspects .

+1 mr . polanski is in his element here : alone , abandoned , but still consoled by his art , which is more than he has ever revealed before about the source of his spiritual survival . 
-1 bray is completely at sea ; with nothing but a savage garden music video on his resume , he has no clue about making a movie . 
+1 gooding is the energetic frontman , and it's hard to resist his enthusiasm , even if the filmmakers come up with nothing original in the way of slapstick sequences . 
+1 not about scares but a mood in which an ominous , pervasive , and unknown threat lurks just below the proceedings and adds an almost constant mindset of suspense . 
-1 the irony is that this film's cast is uniformly superb ; their performances could have -- should have -- been allowed to stand on their own . 
+1  . . . breathes surprising new life into the familiar by amalgamating genres and adding true human complexity to its not-so-stock characters . 
+1 the people in dogtown and z-boys are so funny , aggressive and alive , you have to watch them because you can't wait to see what they do next . 
+1 compelling revenge thriller , though somewhat weakened by a miscast leading lady . 
-1 extreme oops - oops , ops , no matter how you spell it , it's still a mistake to go see it . 
-1 the period -- swinging london in the time of the mods and the rockers -- gets the once-over once again in gangster no . 1 , but falls apart long before the end . 
-1 an uplifting , largely bogus story .

+1 a bright , inventive , thoroughly winning flight of revisionist fancy . 
-1 director david fincher and writer david koepp can't sustain it . 
+1 the strength of the film lies in its two central performances by sven wollter as the stricken composer and viveka seldahl as his desperate violinist wife . 
-1 it's a bad sign when you're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects' deaths just so the documentary will be over , but it's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest . 
-1 the movie has a script ( by paul pender ) made of wood , and it's relentlessly folksy , a procession of stagy set pieces stacked with binary oppositions . 
-1 a tough go , but leigh's depth and rigor , and his skill at inspiring accomplished portrayals that are all the more impressive for their lack of showiness , offsets to a notable degree the film's often-mined and despairing milieu . 
-1 a movie version of a paint-by-numbers picture . we can tell what it is supposed to be , but can't really call it a work of art . 
+1 the fourth " pokemon " is a diverting--if predictable--adventure suitable for a matinee , with a message that cautions children about disturbing the world's delicate ecological balance . 
-1 blade ii has a brilliant director and charismatic star , but it suffers from rampant vampire devaluation . 
+1 exciting documentary . 
+1 the film boasts dry humor and jarring shocks , plus moments of breathtaking mystery . 
-1 deadly dull , pointless meditation on losers in a gone-to-seed hotel .

-1 lazy filmmaking , with the director taking a hands-off approach when he should have shaped the story to show us why it's compelling . 
+1 what makes barbershop so likable , with all its flaws , is that it has none of the pushiness and decibel volume of most contemporary comedies . 
-1 glib , satirical documentary that fudges facts , makes facile points and engages in the cinematic equivalent of tabloid journalism . 
+1 twohy's a good yarn-spinner , and ultimately the story compels . 
+1 thirteen conversations about one thing lays out a narrative puzzle that interweaves individual stories , and , like a mobius strip , elliptically loops back to where it began . 
-1 were dylan thomas alive to witness first-time director ethan hawke's strained chelsea walls , he might have been tempted to change his landmark poem to , 'do not go gentle into that good theatre . '
+1 if you can keep your eyes open amid all the blood and gore , you'll see del toro has brought unexpected gravity to blade ii . 
-1 for its 100 minutes running time , you'll wait in vain for a movie to happen . 
-1 there's no disguising this as one of the worst films of the summer . or for the year , for that matter . 
+1 woo's fights have a distinct flair . his warriors collide in balletic explosion that implies an underlying order throughout the chaos . 
+1 an entertaining british hybrid of comedy , caper thrills and quirky romance . 
-1 thin period piece . 
+1 the best of the pierce brosnan james bond films to date . 
+1 austin powers for the most part is extremely funny , the first part making up for any flaws that come later . 
+1 a film with almost as many delights for adults as there are for children and dog lovers . 
-1 completely creatively stillborn and executed in a manner that i'm not sure could be a single iota worse . . . a soulless hunk of exploitative garbage . 
-1 a loud , brash and mainly unfunny high school comedy . 
-1 i can't remember the last time i saw a movie where i wanted so badly for the protagonist to fail . 
+1 occasionally funny and consistently odd , and it works reasonably well as a star vehicle for zhao . 
+1 preaches to two completely different choirs at the same time , which is a pretty amazing accomplishment . 
+1 a chilling tale of one of the great crimes of 20th century france : the murder of two rich women by their servants in 1933 . 
+1 what's really so appealing about the characters is their resemblance to everyday children . 
+1 a tremendous piece of work . 
+1 perfectly pitched between comedy and tragedy , hope and despair , about schmidt instead comes far closer than many movies to expressing the way many of us live -- someplace between consuming self-absorption and insistently demanding otherness . 
-1 a very slow , uneventful ride around a pretty tattered old carousel . 
+1 miyazaki is one of world cinema's most wondrously gifted artists and storytellers . 
-1 to enjoy this movie's sharp dialogue and delightful performance by jolie and burns , you have to gloss over the no sense ending . 
-1 the movie is almost completely lacking in suspense , surprise and consistent emotional conviction . 
-1 just because it really happened to you , honey , doesn't mean that it's interesting to anyone else . 
+1 at nearly three hours , the whole of safe conduct is less than the sum of its parts . 
-1 so mind-numbingly awful that you hope britney won't do it one more time , as far as movies are concerned . 
+1 no worse a film than breaking out , and breaking out was utterly charming . 
+1 this one is strictly a lightweight escapist film . 
+1 but even with the two-wrongs-make-a-right chemistry between jolie and burns . . . this otherwise appealing picture loses its soul to screenwriting for dummies conformity . 
-1 the script is high on squaddie banter , low on shocks . 
-1 i enjoyed the movie in a superficial way , while never sure what its purpose was . 
+1 clooney directs this film always keeping the balance between the fantastic and the believable . . . 
+1 a fast-moving and remarkable film that appears destined to become a landmark in japanese animation . 
-1 at first , the sight of a blind man directing a film is hilarious , but as the film goes on , the joke wears thin . 
+1 drama of temptation , salvation and good intentions is a thoughtful examination of faith , love and power . 
-1 i hate the feeling of having been slimed in the name of high art . 
-1 suffers from all the excesses of the genre . 
-1 in a 102-minute film , aaliyah gets at most 20 minutes of screen time . . . . most viewers will wish there had been more of the " queen " and less of the " damned . " 
-1 it's not a film to be taken literally on any level , but its focus always appears questionable . 
+1 a work of intricate elegance , literary lyricism and profound common sense . 
+1 katz's documentary doesn't have much panache , but with material this rich it doesn't need it . 
-1 while kids will probably eat the whole thing up , most adults will be way ahead of the plot . 
-1 never again , while nothing special , is pleasant , diverting and modest -- definitely a step in the right direction . 
+1 where bowling for columbine is at its most valuable is in its examination of america's culture of fear as a root cause of gun violence . 
+1 while undisputed isn't exactly a high , it is a gripping , tidy little movie that takes mr . hill higher than he's been in a while . 
+1 an intelligent and deeply felt work about impossible , irrevocable choices and the price of making them . 
+1 while parker and co-writer catherine di napoli are faithful to melville's plotline , they and a fully engaged supporting cast . . . have made the old boy's characters more quick-witted than any english lit major would have thought possible . 
-1 a characteristically engorged and sloppy coming-of-age movie . 
+1 working from a surprisingly sensitive script co-written by gianni romoli . . . ozpetek avoids most of the pitfalls you'd expect in such a potentially sudsy set-up . 
+1 an inuit masterpiece that will give you goosebumps as its uncanny tale of love , communal discord , and justice unfolds . 
+1  . . . enthusiastically invokes the percussion rhythm , the brass soul and the sense of fierce competition that helps make great marching bands half the fun of college football games . 
+1 in the end , punch-drunk love is one of those films that i wanted to like much more than i actually did . sometimes , that's enough . 
+1 smart , provocative and blisteringly funny . 
-1 burns' fifth beer-soaked film feels in almost every possible way -- from the writing and direction to the soggy performances -- tossed off . 
+1 a model of what films like this should be like . 
+1 it's a glorious spectacle like those d . w . griffith made in the early days of silent film . 
+1 as warm as it is wise , deftly setting off uproarious humor with an underlying seriousness that sneaks up on the viewer , providing an experience that is richer than anticipated . 
-1 jam-packed with literally bruising jokes . every five minutes or so , someone gets clocked . 
+1 an asian neo-realist treasure . 
+1 ozpetek joins the ranks of those gay filmmakers who have used the emigre experience to explore same-sex culture in ways that elude the more nationally settled . 
-1 i'm not sure which half of dragonfly is worse : the part where nothing's happening , or the part where something's happening , but it's stupid . 
+1 a complex psychological drama about a father who returns to his son's home after decades away . 
+1 it is a testament of quiet endurance , of common concern , of reconciled survival . 
+1 an absorbing , slice-of-depression life that touches nerves and rings true . 
+1 somewhere short of tremors on the modern b-scene : neither as funny nor as clever , though an agreeably unpretentious way to spend ninety minutes . 
-1 in addition to sporting one of the worst titles in recent cinematic history , ballistic : ecks vs . sever also features terrible , banal dialogue ; convenient , hole-ridden plotting ; superficial characters and a rather dull , unimaginative car chase . 
-1 because of an unnecessary and clumsy last scene , 'swimfan' left me with a very bad feeling . 
+1 stock up on silver bullets for director neil marshall's intense freight train of a film . 
+1 for anyone who remembers the '60s or is interested in one man's response to stroke , ram dass : fierce grace is worth seeking out .

+1 its sheer dynamism is infectious . 
-1 i didn't believe for a moment in these villains or their plot . 
-1 i'm not exactly sure what this movie thinks it is about . 
+1 a remarkable movie with an unsatisfying ending , which is just the point . 
-1 tries to work in the same vein as the brilliance of animal house but instead comes closer to the failure of the third revenge of the nerds sequel . 
-1 this movie is maddening . it conveys a simple message in a visual style that is willfully overwrought . 
-1 her fans walked out muttering words like " horrible " and " terrible , " but had so much fun dissing the film that they didn't mind the ticket cost . in this case zero . 
+1 definitely worth 95 minutes of your time . 
-1 a perfect example of rancid , well-intentioned , but shamelessly manipulative movie making . 
+1 this romantic thriller is steeped in the atmosphere of wartime england , and ably captures the speech patterns , moral codes and ideals of the 1940s . 
-1 there's surely something wrong with a comedy where the only belly laughs come from the selection of outtakes tacked onto the end credits . 
-1 sex with strangers will shock many with its unblinking frankness . but what is missing from it all is a moral . what is the filmmakers' point ? why did they deem it necessary to document all this emotional misery ? 
+1 what makes the movie work ¬ó to an admittedly limited extent ¬ó is the commitment of two genuinely engaging performers . weaver and lapaglia are both excellent , in the kind of low-key way that allows us to forget that they are actually movie folk . 
+1 as tricky and satisfying as any of david mamet's airless cinematic shell games . 
+1 this is a winning ensemble comedy that shows canadians can put gentle laughs and equally gentle sentiments on the button , just as easily as their counterparts anywhere else in the world . 
+1 a comedy that is warm , inviting , and surprising . 
+1 with the same sort of good-natured fun found in films like tremors , eight legged freaks is prime escapist fare . 
+1 winds up being both revelatory and narcissistic , achieving some honest insight into relationships that most high-concept films candy-coat with pat storylines , precious circumstances and beautiful stars . 
-1 while it is interesting to witness the conflict from the palestinian side , longley's film lacks balance . . . and fails to put the struggle into meaningful historical context . 
-1 rather than real figures , elling and kjell bjarne become symbolic characters whose actions are supposed to relate something about the na√Øf's encounter with the world . 
+1 a depressing confirmation of everything those of us who don't object to the description " unelected " have suspected all along : george w . bush is an incurious , uncharismatic , overgrown frat boy with a mean streak a mile wide . 
-1 why make a documentary about these marginal historical figures ? wouldn't one about their famous dad , author of death in venice , etc . , be more valuable ? 
+1 sem se preocupar em criar momentos melodram√°ticos para arrancar l√°grimas do espectador , o pianista √© um filme triste sem que , para isso , precise ser emocionante . 
+1 cage makes an unusual but pleasantly haunting debut behind the camera . 
+1 a smart , sweet and playful romantic comedy . 
-1 two hours of junk . 
-1 like most movies about the pitfalls of bad behavior . . . circuit gets drawn into the party . 
+1 even these tales of just seven children seem at times too many , although in reality they are not enough . every child's story is what matters . this film can only point the way -- but thank goodness for this signpost . 
-1 one of those pictures whose promising , if rather precious , premise is undercut by amateurish execution . 
-1 a hit- and-miss affair , consistently amusing but not as outrageous or funny as cho may have intended or as imaginative as one might have hoped . 
+1 this bold and lyrical first feature from raja amari expands the pat notion that middle-aged women just wanna have fun into a rousing treatise of sensual empowerment . 
-1 it's the type of stunt the academy loves : a powerful political message stuffed into an otherwise mediocre film . 
-1 even if you feel like you've seen this movie a thousand times before , it is kind of enjoyable thanks mainly to belushi's easy-going likableness . 
+1 sure , i hated myself in the morning . but then again , i hate myself most mornings . i still like moonlight mile , better judgment be damned . 
+1 a deliberative account of a lifestyle characterized by its surface-obsession ¬ñ one that typifies the delirium of post , pre , and extant stardom . 
-1 director oliver parker labors so hard to whip life into the importance of being earnest that he probably pulled a muscle or two . 
+1 [a] devastatingly powerful and astonishingly vivid holocaust drama . 
+1 young everlyn sampi , as the courageous molly craig , simply radiates star-power potential in this remarkable and memorable film . 
-1 the modern-day characters are nowhere near as vivid as the 19th-century ones . 
+1 the film delivers not just the full assault of reno's immense wit and insight , but a time travel back to what it felt like during those unforgettably uncertain days . 
+1 the film provides some great insight into the neurotic mindset of all comics -- even those who have reached the absolute top of the game . 
-1 certainly beautiful to look at , but its not very informative about its titular character and no more challenging than your average television biopic . 
-1 you come away thinking not only that kate isn't very bright , but that she hasn't been worth caring about and that maybe she , janine and molly -- an all-woman dysfunctional family -- deserve one another . 
+1  " antwone fisher " is an earnest , by-the-numbers effort by washington . it won't rock any boats but is solid meat-and-potatoes filmmaking . 
+1 broomfield has a rather unique approach to documentary . he thinks the film is just as much a document about him as it is about the subject . 
-1 shows holmes has the screen presence to become a major-league leading lady , ( but ) the movie itself is an underachiever , a psychological mystery that takes its sweet time building to a climax that's scarcely a surprise by the time it arrives . 
-1 just a kiss wants desperately to come off as a fanciful film about the typical problems of average people . but it is set in a world that is very , very far from the one most of us inhabit . 
-1 this is a remake by the numbers , linking a halfwit plot to a series of standup routines in which wilson and murphy show how funny they could have been in a more ambitious movie . 
-1 the movie wavers between hallmark card sentimentality and goofy , life-affirming moments straight out of a cellular phone commercial . 
+1 the overall effect is awe and affection -- and a strange urge to get on a board and , uh , shred , dude . 
-1 automatically pegs itself for the straight-to-video sci-fi rental shelf . 
+1 there's something poignant about an artist of 90-plus years taking the effort to share his impressions of life and loss and time and art with us . 
-1 befuddled in its characterizations as it begins to seem as long as the two year affair which is its subject
-1 even on those rare occasions when the narrator stops yammering , miller's hand often feels unsure . 
+1 there is no substitute for on-screen chemistry , and when friel pulls the strings that make williams sink into melancholia , the reaction in williams is as visceral as a gut punch . 
+1 lapaglia's ability to convey grief and hope works with weaver's sensitive reactions to make this a two-actor master class . 
-1 rarely has sex on screen been so aggressively anti-erotic . 
-1 yo , it's the days of our lives meets electric boogaloo . 
-1 only those most addicted to film violence in all its forms will find anything here to appreciate . 
+1 cremaster 3 is at once a tough pill to swallow and a minor miracle of self-expression . 
-1 yet another weepy southern bore-athon . 
-1 although trying to balance self-referential humor and a normal ol' slasher plot seemed like a decent endeavor , the result doesn't fully satisfy either the die-hard jason fans or those who can take a good joke . 
-1 the film equivalent of a toy chest whose contents get scattered over the course of 80 minutes . 
+1 a rip-roaring comedy action fest that'll put hairs on your chest . 
-1 director-chef gabriele muccino keeps it fast -- zippy , comin' at ya -- as if fearing that his film is molto superficiale . 
-1 however stale the material , lawrence's delivery remains perfect ; his great gift is that he can actually trick you into thinking some of this worn-out , pandering palaver is actually funny . 
-1 cattaneo reworks the formula that made the full monty a smashing success . . . but neglects to add the magic that made it all work . 
+1 rare birds has more than enough charm to make it memorable . 
+1 claude chabrol's camera has a way of gently swaying back and forth as it cradles its characters , veiling tension beneath otherwise tender movements . 
+1 weird , vulgar comedy that's definitely an acquired taste . 
-1 must-see viewing for anyone involved in the high-tech industry . others may find it migraine-inducing , despite moore's attempts at whimsy and spoon feeding . 
+1 like mike is a harmlessly na√Øve slice of b-ball fantasy , fit for filling in during the real nba's off-season . 
-1 an overblown clunker full of bad jokes , howling cliches and by-the-numbers action sequences . 
-1 kicks off with an inauspicious premise , mopes through a dreary tract of virtually plotless meanderings and then ends with a whimper . 
-1 more intellectually scary than dramatically involving . 
-1 you can tell almost immediately that welcome to collinwood isn't going to jell . 
+1 for a long time the film succeeds with its dark , delicate treatment of these characters and its unerring respect for them . 
-1 take away all the cliches and the carbon copy scenes from every drug movie we've seen and all you have left are john leguizamo's cool jackets . 
-1 these are textbook lives of quiet desperation . 
+1 an incredibly clever and superbly paced caper filled with scams within scams within scams . 
+1  . . . a polished and relatively sincere piece of escapism . 
-1 sorority boys , which is as bad at it is cruel , takes every potential laugh and stiletto-stomps the life out of it . 
-1 mckay seems embarrassed by his own invention and tries to rush through the intermediary passages , apparently hoping that the audience will not notice the glaring triteness of the plot device he has put in service . 
+1 the faithful will enjoy this sometimes wry adaptation of v . s . naipaul's novel , but newcomers may find themselves stifling a yawn or two during the first hour . 
+1 kids should have a stirring time at this beautifully drawn movie . and adults will at least have a dream image of the west to savor whenever the film's lamer instincts are in the saddle . 
+1 frailty isn't as gory or explicit . but in its child-centered , claustrophobic context , it can be just as frightening and disturbing -- even punishing . 
+1 it's a compelling and horrifying story , and the laramie project is worthwhile for reminding us that this sort of thing does , in fact , still happen in america . 
+1 a much better documentary -- more revealing , more emotional and more surprising -- than its pedestrian english title would have you believe . 
-1 there's a heavy stench of 'been there , done that' hanging over the film . it's everything you'd expect -- but nothing more . 
+1 while it's nothing we haven't seen before from murphy , i spy is still fun and enjoyable and so aggressively silly that it's more than a worthwhile effort . 
+1 windtalkers blows this way and that , but there's no mistaking the filmmaker in the tall grass , true to himself . 
+1  " frailty " offers chills much like those that you get when sitting around a campfire around midnight , telling creepy stories to give each other the willies . and , there's no way you won't be talking about the film once you exit the theater . 
-1 de niro may enjoy the same free ride from critics afforded to clint eastwood in the lazy bloodwork . but like bruce springsteen's gone-to-pot asbury park , new jersey , this sad-sack waste of a movie is a city of ruins . 
-1 can't get enough of libidinous young city dwellers ? try this obscenely bad dark comedy , so crass that it makes edward burns' sidewalks of new york look like oscar wilde . 
-1 collapses after 30 minutes into a slap-happy series of adolescent violence . 
+1 a film centering on a traditional indian wedding in contemporary new delhi may not sound like specialized fare , but mira nair's film is an absolute delight for all audiences . 
-1 this franchise has not spawned a single good film . the crap continues . 
-1 loosely speaking , we're in all of me territory again , and , strictly speaking , schneider is no steve martin . 
+1 makes an aborbing if arguable case for the man's greatness . 
-1 even if the enticing prospect of a lot of nubile young actors in a film about campus depravity didn't fade amid the deliberate , tiresome ugliness , it would be rendered tedious by avary's failure to construct a story with even a trace of dramatic interest . 
-1 the plot combines the blues brothers and almost famous ( but with bears , and a g rating ) , with an excruciating dollop of disney sentimentality mixed in for good measure . 
+1 this often-hilarious farce manages to generate the belly laughs of lowbrow comedy without sacrificing its high-minded appeal . 
-1 hard as this may be to believe , here on earth , a surprisingly similar teen drama , was a better film . 
-1 the somber pacing and lack of dramatic fireworks make green dragon seem more like medicine than entertainment . 
+1 as janice , eileen walsh , an engaging , wide-eyed actress whose teeth are a little too big for her mouth , infuses the movie with much of its slender , glinting charm . 
-1 a very familiar tale , one that's been told by countless filmmakers about italian- , chinese- , irish- , latin- , indian- , russian- and other hyphenate american young men struggling to balance conflicting cultural messages . 
-1 like a bad improvisation exercise , the superficially written characters ramble on tediously about their lives , loves and the art they're struggling to create . 
-1 director hoffman , his writer and kline's agent should serve detention
-1 this 100-minute movie only has about 25 minutes of decent material . 
-1 a long , dull procession of despair , set to cello music culled from a minimalist funeral . 
+1 'tobey maguire is a poster boy for the geek generation . '
+1 surprisingly , the film is a hilarious adventure and i shamelessly enjoyed it . 
+1 a gem of a movie . 
-1 it's hard to believe these jokers are supposed to have pulled off four similar kidnappings before . 
-1 the rollerball sequences feel sanitised and stagey . 
-1 in its own way , joshua is as blasphemous and nonsensical as a luis bu√±uel film without the latter's attendant intelligence , poetry , passion , and genius . 
+1 i found the ring moderately absorbing , largely for its elegantly colorful look and sound . 
+1 the best thing i can say about this film is that i can't wait to see what the director does next . 
+1 could this be the first major studio production shot on video tape instead of film ? 
-1 feels haphazard , as if the writers mistakenly thought they could achieve an air of frantic spontaneity by simply tossing in lots of characters doing silly stuff and stirring the pot . 
-1 breen's script is sketchy with actorish notations on the margin of acting . 
-1 the cast is uniformly excellent . . . but the film itself is merely mildly charming . 
+1  . . . works on some levels and is certainly worth seeing at least once . 
+1 writer/director david caesar ladles on the local flavour with a hugely enjoyable film about changing times , clashing cultures and the pleasures of a well-made pizza . 
+1 the film serves as a valuable time capsule to remind us of the devastating horror suffered by an entire people . 
+1 a disturbing examination of what appears to be the definition of a 'bad' police shooting . 
+1 the actors are so terrific at conveying their young angst , we do indeed feel for them . 
+1 a pretty funny movie , with most of the humor coming , as before , from the incongruous but chemically perfect teaming of crystal and de niro . 
+1 a resonant tale of racism , revenge and retribution . 
-1 apparently reassembled from the cutting-room floor of any given daytime soap . 
+1 seeks to transcend its genre with a curiously stylized , quasi-shakespearean portrait of pure misogynist evil . 
-1 surprisingly , considering that baird is a former film editor , the movie is rather choppy . 
+1 while not for every taste , this often very funny collegiate gross-out comedy goes a long way toward restoring the luster of the national lampoon film franchise , too long reduced to direct-to-video irrelevancy . 
+1 drops you into a dizzying , volatile , pressure-cooker of a situation that quickly snowballs out of control , while focusing on the what much more than the why . 
+1 at times auto focus feels so distant you might as well be watching it through a telescope . yet in its own aloof , unreachable way it's so fascinating you won't be able to look away for a second . 
-1 schaefer's . . . determination to inject farcical raunch . . . drowns out the promise of the romantic angle . 
-1 any film featuring young children threatened by a terrorist bomb can no longer pass as mere entertainment . 
-1 at best this is a film for the under-7 crowd . but it would be better to wait for the video . and a very rainy day . 
-1 when it comes to the battle of hollywood vs . woo , it looks like woo's a p . o . w . 
+1 there is a beautiful , aching sadness to it all . paul cox needed to show it . it is up to you to decide if you need to see it . 
-1 it takes a certain kind of horror movie to qualify as 'worse than expected , ' but ghost ship somehow manages to do exactly that . 
+1 engrossing and affecting , if ultimately not quite satisfying . 
+1 contradicts everything we've come to expect from movies nowadays . instead of simply handling conventional material in a conventional way , secretary takes the most unexpected material and handles it in the most unexpected way . 
-1 while obviously an extremely personal work , it remains inextricably stuck in an emotionally unavailable rut . 
+1 although the subject matter may still be too close to recent national events , the film works - mostly due to its superior cast of characters . 
-1 it's all pretty tame . the most offensive thing about the movie is that hollywood expects people to pay to see it . 
+1  . . . certainly an entertaining ride , despite many talky , slow scenes . but something seems to be missing . a sense of real magic , perhaps . 
+1 a cruelly funny twist on teen comedy packed with inventive cinematic tricks and an ironically killer soundtrack
+1 sensitively examines general issues of race and justice among the poor , and specifically raises serious questions about the death penalty and asks what good the execution of a mentally challenged woman could possibly do . 
-1 after several scenes of this tacky nonsense , you'll be wistful for the testosterone-charged wizardry of jerry bruckheimer productions , especially because half past dead is like the rock on a wal-mart budget . 
-1 just consider what new best friend does not have , beginning with the minor omission of a screenplay . 
-1 dripping with cliche and bypassing no opportunity to trivialize the material . 
+1 a very well-meaning movie , and it will stand in future years as an eloquent memorial to the world trade center tragedy . 
-1 the only thing that distinguishes a randall wallace film from any other is the fact that there is nothing distinguishing in a randall wallace film . 
+1 while puerile men dominate the story , the women shine . 
-1 ver wiel's desperate attempt at wit is lost , leaving the character of critical jim two-dimensional and pointless . 
+1 laced with liberal doses of dark humor , gorgeous exterior photography , and a stable-full of solid performances , no such thing is a fascinating little tale . 
+1 steven soderbergh doesn't remake andrei tarkovsky's solaris so much as distill it . 
+1 hartley adds enough quirky and satirical touches in the screenplay to keep the film entertaining . 
+1 at its most basic , this cartoon adventure is that wind-in-the-hair exhilarating . 
+1 i like this movie a lot . i like that smith , he's not making fun of these people , he's not laughing at them . 
-1 nicks refuses to let slackers be seen as just another teen movie , which means he can be forgiven for frequently pandering to fans of the gross-out comedy . 
-1 most of the movie is so deadly dull that watching the proverbial paint dry would be a welcome improvement . 
-1 as an actor , the rock is aptly named . 
-1 [i]f you've been to more than one indie flick in your life , chances are you've already seen this kind of thing . 
-1 glizty but formulaic and silly . . . cagney's 'top of the world' has been replaced by the bottom of the barrel . 
+1  . . . a solid , unassuming drama . 
+1 if the material is slight and admittedly manipulative , jacquot preserves tosca's intoxicating ardor through his use of the camera . 
+1  . . . once the true impact of the day unfolds , the power of this movie is undeniable . 
+1 a thoughtful , moving piece that faces difficult issues with honesty and beauty . 
+1 this is historical filmmaking without the balm of right-thinking ideology , either liberal or conservative . mr . scorsese's bravery and integrity in advancing this vision can hardly be underestimated . 
-1 an ill-conceived jumble that's not scary , not smart and not engaging . 
-1 i have no problem with " difficult " movies , or movies that ask the audience to meet them halfway and connect the dots instead of having things all spelled out . but first , you have to give the audience a reason to <b>want</b> to put for that effort , and " i
-1 the story is also as unoriginal as they come , already having been recycled more times than i'd care to count . 
-1 blue crush is so prolonged and boring it isn't even close to being the barn-burningly bad movie it promised it would be . 
-1 an overstuffed compendium of teen-catholic-movie dogma . 
-1 none of this violates the letter of behan's book , but missing is its spirit , its ribald , full-throated humor . 
-1 dramatically lackluster . 
+1  " the quiet american " begins in saigon in 1952 . that's its first sign of trouble . 
-1 message movie or an action-packed submarine spectacular ? alas , it's neither . 
-1 the best way to hope for any chance of enjoying this film is by lowering your expectations . then lower them a bit more . 
-1 sam mendes has become valedictorian at the school for soft landings and easy ways out . 
-1 one suspects that craven endorses they simply because this movie makes his own look much better by comparison . 
-1 shamelessly sappy and , worse , runs away from its own provocative theme . 
-1 it treats women like idiots . 
-1 it's lazy for a movie to avoid solving one problem by trying to distract us with the solution to another . 
+1 even if the ride's a little bumpy , with a final lap that's all too suspiciously smooth , you gotta give director roger michell , best known for the superfluous notting hill , credit for trying . 
-1 with its lackadaisical plotting and mindless action , all about the benjamins evokes the bottom tier of blaxploitation flicks from the 1970s . 
+1 there are as many misses as hits , but ultimately , it finds humor in the foibles of human behavior , and it's a welcome return to the roots of a genre that should depend on surprises . 
+1 a gripping documentary that reveals how deep the antagonism lies in war-torn jerusalem . 
-1 impostor is a step down for director gary fleder . 
+1 wise and deadpan humorous .

+1 morvern callar confirms lynne ramsay as an important , original talent in international cinema . 
-1 slack and uninspired , and peopled mainly by characters so unsympathetic that you're left with a sour taste in your mouth . 
+1 a savvy exploration of paranoia and insecurity in america's culture of fear . 
-1 the inherent limitations of using a video game as the source material movie are once again made all too clear in this schlocky horror/action hybrid . 
+1  . . . spiced with humor ( 'i speak fluent flatula , ' advises denlopp after a rather , er , bubbly exchange with an alien deckhand ) and witty updatings ( silver's parrot has been replaced with morph , a cute alien creature who mimics everyone and everything around ) 
-1 the film tries to touch on spousal abuse but veers off course and becomes just another revenge film . 
-1 friday after next is the kind of film that could only be made by african-americans because of its broad racial insensitivity towards african-americans . 
+1 renner carries much of the film with a creepy and dead-on performance . 
-1 dialogue-heavy and too cerebral for its own good -- or , at any rate , too cerebral for its racy subject matter . 
+1 a genuinely funny ensemble comedy that also asks its audience -- in a heartwarming , nonjudgmental kind of way -- to consider what we value in our daily lives . 
+1 it is risky , intelligent , romantic and rapturous from start to finish . 
-1 i spy is an embarrassment , a monotonous , disjointed jumble of borrowed plot points and situations . it's as flat as an open can of pop left sitting in the sun . 
+1 a fascinating documentary about the long and eventful spiritual journey of the guru who helped launch the new age . 
+1 constantly touching , surprisingly funny , semi-surrealist exploration of the creative act . 
-1 clockstoppers is one of those crazy , mixed-up films that doesn't know what it wants to be when it grows up . 
-1 the premise itself is just sooooo tired . pair that with really poor comedic writing . . . and you've got a huge mess . 
-1 city by the sea is the cinematic equivalent of defensive driving : it's careful , conscientious and makes no major mistakes . but what saves lives on the freeway does not necessarily make for persuasive viewing . 
-1 for casual moviegoers who stumble into rules expecting a slice of american pie hijinks starring the kid from dawson's creek , they'll probably run out screaming . 
-1 wow . i have not been this disappointed by a movie in a long time . 
+1 rare is the 'urban comedy' that even attempts the insight and honesty of this disarming indie . 
-1 yes , i suppose it's lovely that cal works out his issues with his dad and comes to terms with his picture-perfect life -- but world traveler gave me no reason to care , so i didn't . 
-1 will anyone who isn't a fangoria subscriber be excited that it hasn't gone straight to video ? 
-1 directed by kevin bray , whose crisp framing , edgy camera work , and wholesale ineptitude with acting , tone and pace very obviously mark him as a video helmer making his feature debut . 
-1 ken russell would love this . in one scene , we get a stab at soccer hooliganism , a double-barreled rip-off of quentin tarantino's climactic shootout ¬ó and meat loaf explodes . 
+1 an unexpectedly sweet story of sisterhood . 
-1 all of the elements are in place for a great film noir , but director george hickenlooper's approach to the material is too upbeat . 
-1 first-time writer-director dylan kidd also has a good ear for dialogue , and the characters sound like real people . 
-1 the pacing is glacial , the screenplay is stiff as a board , and things heat up only in the movie's final scenes . 
-1 the film boasts at least a few good ideas and features some decent performances , but the result is disappointing . 
-1 i felt sad for lise not so much because of what happens as because she was captured by this movie when she obviously belongs in something lighter and sunnier , by rohmer , for example . 
+1 a quiet family drama with a little bit of romance and a dose of darkness . 
+1 it does give a taste of the burning man ethos , an appealing blend of counter-cultural idealism and hedonistic creativity . 
+1 leave it to the french to truly capture the terrifying angst of the modern working man without turning the film into a cheap thriller , a dumb comedy or a sappy melodrama . 
+1  . . . [the film] works , due mostly to the tongue-in-cheek attitude of the screenplay . 
-1 amazingly dopey . 
+1 adam sandler ! in an art film ! 
-1 who is this movie for ? not kids , who don't need the lesson in repugnance . it's also not smart or barbed enough for older viewers -- not everyone thinks poo-poo jokes are 'edgy . '
+1 the recording session is the only part of the film that is enlightening -- and how appreciative you are of this depends on your level of fandom . 
+1 a gorgeous , witty , seductive movie . 
+1 watching haneke's film is , aptly enough , a challenge and a punishment . but watching huppert , a great actress tearing into a landmark role , is riveting . 
+1 watching e . t now , in an era dominated by cold , loud special-effects-laden extravaganzas , one is struck less by its lavish grandeur than by its intimacy and precision . 
-1 bears is even worse than i imagined a movie ever could be . 
+1 a movie that sends you out of the theater feeling like you've actually spent time living in another community . 
-1 feels like one of those contrived , only-in -hollywood productions where name actors deliver big performances created for the sole purpose of generating oscar talk . 
-1 obvious
-1 spain's greatest star wattage doesn't overcome the tumult of maudlin tragedy . 
-1 i kept wishing i was watching a documentary about the wartime navajos and what they accomplished instead of all this specious hollywood hoo-ha . 
+1 [villeneuve] seems to realize intuitively that even morality is reduced to an option by the ultimate mysteries of life and death . 
-1 unfortunately , a cast of competent performers from movies , television and the theater are cast adrift in various new york city locations with no unifying rhythm or visual style . 
+1  . . . takes the beauty of baseball and melds it with a story that could touch anyone regardless of their familiarity with the sport
+1 a fiercely clever and subtle film , capturing the precarious balance between the extravagant confidence of the exiled aristocracy and the cruel earnestness of the victorious revolutionaries . 
-1 what's missing in murder by numbers is any real psychological grounding for the teens' deviant behaviour . being latently gay and liking to read are hardly enough . 
+1 it's more enjoyable than i expected , though , and that's because the laughs come from fairly basic comedic constructs . cinematic pratfalls given a working over . the cast is spot on and the mood is laid back . 
-1 grant isn't cary and bullock isn't katherine . 
-1 sounding like arnold schwarzenegger , with a physique to match , [ahola] has a wooden delivery and encounters a substantial arc of change that doesn't produce any real transformation . 
+1 the story , once it gets rolling , is nothing short of a great one . 
-1 elegantly crafted but emotionally cold , a puzzle whose intricate construction one can admire but is difficult to connect with on any deeper level . 
+1 you won't look at religious fanatics -- or backyard sheds -- the same way again . 
-1 we've liked klein's other work but rollerball left us cold . 
-1 the cold and dreary weather is a perfect metaphor for the movie itself , which contains few laughs and not much drama . 
+1 its engaging simplicity is driven by appealing leads . 
-1 deuces wild treads heavily into romeo and juliet/west side story territory , where it plainly has no business going . 
+1 sillier , cuter , and shorter than the first ( as best i remember ) , but still a very good time at the cinema . 
-1 thoroughly awful . 
+1 you'll be left with the sensation of having just witnessed a great performance and , perhaps , give in to the urge to get on your feet and shake it . 
-1 this little film is so slovenly done , so primitive in technique , that it can't really be called animation . 
-1 if you're over 25 , have an iq over 90 , and have a driver's license , you should be able to find better entertainment . 
+1 a truly wonderful tale combined with stunning animation . 
+1 what really surprises about wisegirls is its low-key quality and genuine tenderness . 
+1 bursting through the constraints of its source , this is one adapted- from-television movie that actually looks as if it belongs on the big screen . 
+1 the performances are remarkable . 
+1 the film is predictable in the reassuring manner of a beautifully sung holiday carol . 
-1 any enjoyment will be hinge from a personal threshold of watching sad but endearing characters do extremely unconventional things . 
-1 fails so fundamentally on every conventional level that it achieves some kind of goofy grandeur . 
+1 for those who are intrigued by politics of the '70s , the film is every bit as fascinating as it is flawed . 
-1 smothered by its own solemnity . 
-1 as the movie dragged on , i thought i heard a mysterious voice , and felt myself powerfully drawn toward the light -- the light of the exit sign . i have returned from the beyond to warn you : this movie is 90 minutes long , and life is too short . 
+1 there is a subversive element to this disney cartoon , providing unexpected fizzability . 
-1 the gags , and the script , are a mixed bag . 
+1 offers a clear-eyed chronicle of a female friendship that is more complex and honest than anything represented in a hollywood film . 
-1 'synthetic' is the best description of this well-meaning , beautifully produced film that sacrifices its promise for a high-powered star pedigree . 
+1 although olivier assayas' elegantly appointed period drama seems , at times , padded with incident in the way of a too-conscientious adaptation . . . its three-hour running time plays closer to two . 
-1 shows that jackie chan is getting older , and that's something i would rather live in denial about
+1 it's not particularly well made , but since i found myself howling more than cringing , i'd say the film works . 
-1 not since freddy got fingered has a major release been so painful to sit through . 
-1 an annoying orgy of excess and exploitation that has no point and goes nowhere . 
-1 what's next : " my mother the car ? " 
+1 one fantastic ( and educational ) documentary . 
+1 meeting , even exceeding expectations , it's the best sequel since the empire strikes back . . . a majestic achievement , an epic of astonishing grandeur and surprising emotional depth . 
+1 a truly moving experience , and a perfect example of how art -- when done right -- can help heal , clarify , and comfort . 
-1 a 94-minute travesty of unparalleled proportions , writer-director parker seems to go out of his way to turn the legendary wit's classic mistaken identity farce into brutally labored and unfunny hokum . 
+1 every once in a while , a movie will come along that turns me into that annoying specimen of humanity that i usually dread encountering the most - the fanboy
-1 the sequel is everything the original was not : contrived , overblown and tie-in ready . 
+1 an entertaining documentary that freshly considers arguments the bard's immortal plays were written by somebody else . 
-1 nothing more than four or five mild chuckles surrounded by 86 minutes of overly-familiar and poorly-constructed comedy . 
+1 it's got some pretentious eye-rolling moments and it didn't entirely grab me , but there's stuff here to like . 
-1 alternately frustrating and rewarding . 
+1 provide[s] nail-biting suspense and credible characters without relying on technology-of-the-moment technique or pretentious dialogue . 
-1 a film without surprise geared toward maximum comfort and familiarity . 
+1 escapism in its purest form . 
-1 not a bad premise , but the execution is lackluster at best . 
-1 a little too ponderous to work as shallow entertainment , not remotely incisive enough to qualify as drama , monsoon wedding serves mostly to whet one's appetite for the bollywood films . 
+1 filmmaker tian zhuangzhuang triumphantly returns to narrative filmmaking with a visually masterful work of quiet power . 
-1 the whole movie is simply a lazy exercise in bad filmmaking that asks you to not only suspend your disbelief but your intelligence as well . 
-1 dolman confines himself to shtick and sentimentality -- the one bald and the other sloppy . 
-1 a lifetime movie about men . 
+1 a work of the utmost subtlety and perception , it marks the outstanding feature debut of writer-director eric byler , who understands the power of the implicit and the virtues of simplicity and economy . 
-1 the film's trailer also looked like crap , so crap is what i was expecting . 
-1 a fan film that for the uninitiated plays better on video with the sound turned down . 
-1 a lame comedy . 
-1 ultimately , the film never recovers from the clumsy clich√© of the ugly american abroad , and the too-frosty exterior ms . paltrow employs to authenticate her british persona is another liability . 
-1 witless , pointless , tasteless and idiotic . 
-1 unless you are in dire need of a diesel fix , there is no real reason to see it . wait for video -- and then don't rent it . 
+1  . . . manages to fall closer in quality to silence than to the abysmal hannibal . 
+1 better than the tepid star trek : insurrection ; falls short of first contact because the villain couldn't pick the lint off borg queen alice krige's cape ; and finishes half a parsec ( a nose ) ahead of generations . 
+1 the piece plays as well as it does thanks in large measure to anspaugh's three lead actresses . 
-1 so aggressively cheery that pollyana would reach for a barf bag . 
+1 in its own floundering way , it gets to you . just like igby . 
-1 though ganesh is successful in a midlevel sort of way , there's nothing so striking or fascinating or metaphorically significant about his career as to rate two hours of our attention . 
+1 offers an interesting look at the rapidly changing face of beijing . 
-1 anemic , pretentious . 
+1 the bottom line is the piece works brilliantly . 
+1 it helps that the central performers are experienced actors , and that they know their roles so well . 
+1 the film runs on equal parts of innocence and wisdom -- wisdom that comes with experience . it has fun being grown up . 
-1 taken purely as an exercise in style , this oppressively gloomy techno-horror clambake is impossible to ignore . but as a movie , it's a humorless , disjointed mess . 
-1 if there was any doubt that peter o'fallon didn't have an original bone in his body , a rumor of angels should dispel it . 
-1 an admitted egomaniac , evans is no hollywood villain , and yet this grating showcase almost makes you wish he'd gone the way of don simpson . 
+1 does point the way for adventurous indian filmmakers toward a crossover into nonethnic markets . 
+1 as a film director , labute continues to improve . 
-1 with a tone as variable as the cinematography , schaeffer's film never settles into the light-footed enchantment the material needs , and the characters' quirks and foibles never jell into charm . 
-1 pretentious editing ruins a potentially terrific flick . 
-1 eckstraordinarily lame and severely boring . 
-1 the average local news columnist has a bigger rant on the war between modern landscape architecture and small-town america . 
+1 karmen moves like rhythm itself , her lips chanting to the beat , her long , braided hair doing little to wipe away the jeweled beads of sweat . 
-1 'punch-drunk love is so convinced of its own brilliance that , if it were a person , you'd want to smash its face in . '
-1 what little atmosphere is generated by the shadowy lighting , macabre sets , and endless rain is offset by the sheer ugliness of everything else . 
-1 we haven't seen such hilarity since say it isn't so ! 
-1 returning aggressively to his formula of dimwitted comedy and even dimmer characters , sandler , who also executive produces , has made a film that makes previous vehicles look smart and sassy . 
-1 while the resident evil games may have set new standards for thrills , suspense , and gore for video games , the movie really only succeeds in the third of these . 
-1 an affable but undernourished romantic comedy that fails to match the freshness of the actress-producer and writer's previous collaboration , miss congeniality . 
-1 gaghan captures the half-lit , sometimes creepy intimacy of college dorm rooms , a subtlety that makes the silly , over-the-top coda especially disappointing . 
-1 the problem with movies about angels is they have a tendency to slip into hokum . a rumor of angels doesn't just slip -- it avalanches into forced fuzziness . 
-1 skip the film and buy the philip glass soundtrack cd . 
+1 a mature , deeply felt fantasy of a director's travel through 300 years of russian history . 
-1 it leers , offering next to little insight into its intriguing subject . 
-1 the origin story is well told , and the characters will not disappoint anyone who values the original comic books . it's in the action scenes that things fall apart . 
-1 lyne's latest , the erotic thriller unfaithful , further demonstrates just how far his storytelling skills have eroded . 
+1 while the stoically delivered hokum of hart's war is never fun , it's still a worthy addition to the growing canon of post-saving private ryan tributes to the greatest generation . 
-1  " the road paved with good intentions leads to the video store " 
+1 an estrogen opera so intensely feminine that it serves as the antidote ( and cannier doppelganger ) to diesel's xxx flex-a-thon . 
+1  . . . could easily be called the best korean film of 2002 . 
-1 apallingly absurd . . . the chemistry or lack thereof between newton and wahlberg could turn an imax theater into a 9 " black and white portable tv . 
-1 it's not original , and , robbed of the element of surprise , it doesn't have any huge laughs in its story of irresponsible cops who love to play pranks . 
-1  . . . a pretentious mess . . . 
+1 with an obvious rapport with her actors and a striking style behind the camera , h√©l√®ne angel is definitely a director to watch . 
-1 throw smoochy from the train ! 
+1 for a film that's being advertised as a comedy , sweet home alabama isn't as funny as you'd hoped . for a film that's being advertised as a comedy , sweet home alabama isn't as funny as you'd hoped . 
+1 depending upon your reaction to this movie , you may never again be able to look at a red felt sharpie pen without disgust , a thrill , or the giggles . 
-1 bogs down badly as we absorb jia's moody , bad-boy behavior which he portrays himself in a one-note performance . 
-1 this sort of cute and cloying material is far from zhang's forte and it shows . 
-1 yes , i have given this movie a rating of zero . but fans of the show should not consider this a diss . consider it 'perfection . '
-1 the comedy death to smoochy is a rancorous curiosity : a movie without an apparent audience . 
-1 it plods along methodically , somehow under the assumption that its " dead wife communicating from beyond the grave " framework is even remotely new or interesting . 
+1 the story line may be 127 years old , but el crimen del padre amaro . . . couldn't be more timely in its despairing vision of corruption within the catholic establishment . 
-1 boring and meandering . 
-1 presents a good case while failing to provide a reason for us to care beyond the very basic dictums of human decency . 
+1 at a time when half the so-called real movies are little more than live-action cartoons , it's refreshing to see a cartoon that knows what it is , and knows the form's history . 
-1 maybe leblanc thought , " hey , the movie about the baseball-playing monkey was worse . " 
+1 morton is , as usual , brilliant . 
+1 a good documentary can make interesting a subject you thought would leave you cold . a case in point : doug pray's scratch . 
+1 trapped won't score points for political correctness , but it may cause parents a few sleepless hours -- a sign of its effectiveness . 
-1 the final result makes for adequate entertainment , i suppose , but anyone who has seen chicago on stage will leave the theater feeling they've watched nothing but a pale imitation of the real deal . 
+1 i just loved every minute of this film . 
-1 the elements were all there but lack of a pyschological center knocks it flat . 
+1 the first tunisian film i have ever seen , and it's also probably the most good-hearted yet sensual entertainment i'm likely to see all year . 
-1 being author wells' great-grandson , you'd think filmmaker simon wells would have more reverence for the material . but this costly dud is a far cry from either the book or the beloved film . 
+1 kinnear . . . gives his best screen performance with an oddly winning portrayal of one of life's ultimate losers . 
-1 cinematic poo . 
+1 as chilling and fascinating as philippe mora's modern hitler-study , snide and prejudice . 
+1 the kind of movie that comes along only occasionally , one so unconventional , gutsy and perfectly executed it takes your breath away . 
+1 both a successful adaptation and an enjoyable film in its own right . 
-1 the secrets of time travel will have been discovered , indulged in and rejected as boring before i see this piece of crap again . 
-1 has the feel of an unedited personal journal . 
+1 a wonderful , ghastly film . 
+1 maelstrom is strange and compelling , engrossing and different , a moral tale with a twisted sense of humor . 
+1 even when it drags , we are forced to reflect that its visual imagination is breathtaking
+1 like a south-of-the-border melrose place . 
-1 a movie like the guys is why film criticism can be considered work . 
+1 at its worst the screenplay is callow , but at its best it is a young artist's thoughtful consideration of fatherhood . 
-1  . . . overly melodramatic . . . 
-1 resident evil is what comes from taking john carpenter's ghosts of mars and eliminating the beheadings . in other words , about as bad a film you're likely to see all year . 
-1 due to stodgy , soap opera-ish dialogue , the rest of the cast comes across as stick figures reading lines from a teleprompter . 
-1 it gets the details of its time frame right but it completely misses its emotions . 
+1 a remarkably insightful look at the backstage angst of the stand-up comic . 
+1 could use a little more humanity , but it never lacks in eye-popping visuals . 
-1 the film's hero is a bore and his innocence soon becomes a questionable kind of inexcusable dumb innocence . 
+1 nearly surreal , dabbling in french , this is no simple movie , and you'll be taking a risk if you choose to see it . i enjoyed the ride ( bumps and all ) , creamy depth , and ultimate theme . 
-1 with zoe clarke-williams's lackluster thriller " new best friend " , who needs enemies ? just another generic drama that has nothing going for it other than its exploitive array of obligatory cheap thrills . 
+1 smart and taut . 
+1 a fascinating examination of the joyous , turbulent self-discovery made by a proper , middle-aged woman . 
-1 the only fun part of the movie is playing the obvious game . you try to guess the order in which the kids in the house will be gored . 
-1 ultimately this is a frustrating patchwork : an uneasy marriage of louis begley's source novel ( about schmidt ) and an old payne screenplay . 
-1 the only question . . . is to determine how well the schmaltz is manufactured -- to assess the quality of the manipulative engineering . average , at best , i'm afraid . 
-1 [soderbergh] tends to place most of the psychological and philosophical material in italics rather than trust an audience's intelligence , and he creates an overall sense of brusqueness . 
+1 eyre is on his way to becoming the american indian spike lee . 
+1 take any 12-year-old boy to see this picture , and he'll be your slave for a year . 
-1 a movie that harps on media-constructed 'issues' like whether compromise is the death of self¬Ö this orgasm [won't be an] exceedingly memorable one for most people . 
-1 if the movie were all comedy , it might work better . but it has an ambition to say something about its subjects , but not a willingness . 
+1 a refreshing change from the usual whoopee-cushion effort aimed at the youth market . 
+1 it's hard to fairly judge a film like ringu when you've seen the remake first . many of the effective horror elements are dampened through familiarity , [yet] are worthwhile . 
-1 suffers from a lack of clarity and audacity that a subject as monstrous and pathetic as dahmer demands . 
-1 scores no points for originality , wit , or intelligence . it's a cookie-cutter movie , a cut-and-paste job . 
-1 the script is a disaster , with cloying messages and irksome characters . 
+1 like mike doesn't win any points for originality . it does succeed by following a feel-good formula with a winning style , and by offering its target audience of urban kids some welcome role models and optimism . 
-1 portentous and pretentious , the weight of water is appropriately titled , given the heavy-handedness of it drama . 
+1 much has been written about those years when the psychedelic '60s grooved over into the gay '70s , but words don't really do the era justice . you have to see it . 
-1 the following things are not at all entertaining : the bad sound , the lack of climax and , worst of all , watching seinfeld ( who is also one of the film's producers ) do everything he can to look like a good guy . 
+1 de oliveira creates an emotionally rich , poetically plump and visually fulsome , but never showy , film whose bittersweet themes are reinforced and brilliantly personified by michel piccoli . 
-1 with the dog days of august upon us , think of this dog of a movie as the cinematic equivalent of high humidity . 
+1 a movie that will surely be profane , politically charged music to the ears of cho's fans . 
+1 ana's journey is not a stereotypical one of self-discovery , as she's already comfortable enough in her own skin to be proud of her rubenesque physique . . . 
+1 tender yet lacerating and darkly funny fable . 
+1 if you're burnt out on it's a wonderful life marathons and bored with a christmas carol , it might just be the movie you're looking for . it depends on how well flatulence gags fit into your holiday concept . 
-1 contrived pastiche of caper clich√©s . 
-1 the master of disaster - it's a piece of dreck disguised as comedy . 
+1 for most of the distance the picture provides a satisfyingly unsettling ride into the dark places of our national psyche . 
-1 predecessors the mummy and the mummy returns stand as intellectual masterpieces next to the scorpion king . 
-1  . . . the efforts of its star , kline , to lend some dignity to a dumb story are for naught . 
-1  . . . a hokey piece of nonsense that tries too hard to be emotional . 
-1 obvious politics and rudimentary animation reduce the chances that the appeal of hey arnold ! the movie will reach far beyond its core demographic . 
+1 a huge box-office hit in korea , shiri is a must for genre fans . 
-1 reggio and glass so rhapsodize cynicism , with repetition and languorous slo-mo sequences , that glass's dirgelike score becomes a fang-baring lullaby . 
+1 where janice beard falters in its recycled aspects , implausibility , and sags in pace , it rises in its courageousness , and comedic employment . 
-1 there's a solid woman- finding-herself story somewhere in here , but you'd have to dig pretty deep to uncover it . 
-1 'es en verdad una pena que mandoki est√© realizando cintas tan malas desde hace alg√∫n tiempo , pues talento tiene , pero qui√©n sabe d√≥nde lo tiene escondido . '
-1  . . . the film suffers from a lack of humor ( something needed to balance out the violence ) . . . 
-1 the rest of the plot is impossible to explain without blowing whatever tension there is , although it's more comedy than suspense de palma creates . 
+1 all of it works smoothly under the direction of spielberg , who does a convincing impersonation here of a director enjoying himself immensely . 
-1  " collateral damage " goes by the numbers and reps decent action entertainment ¬ñ until the silly showdown ending that forces the viewer to totally suspend disbelief
+1 this isn't exactly profound cinema , but it's good-natured and sometimes quite funny . 
+1 works as pretty contagious fun . 
+1 mama africa pretty much delivers on that promise . it does give you a peek . the main problem being that it's only a peek . 
+1 my goodness , queen latifah has a lot to offer and she seemed to have no problem flaunting her natural gifts . she must have a very strong back . 
-1 some of their jokes work , but most fail miserably and in the end , pumpkin is far more offensive than it is funny . 
+1 a pro-fat farce that overcomes much of its excessive moral baggage thanks to two appealing lead performances . 
-1 stitch is a bad mannered , ugly and destructive little * * * * . no cute factor here¬Ö . not that i mind ugly ; the problem is he has no character , loveable or otherwise . 
-1 eventually arrives at its heart , as simple self-reflection meditation . 
-1 the story is so light and sugary that were it a macy's thanksgiving day parade balloon , extra heavy-duty ropes would be needed to keep it from floating away . 
+1 you'd have to be a most hard-hearted person not to be moved by this drama . 
-1 a film of empty , fetishistic violence in which murder is casual and fun . 
+1 a heartening tale of small victories and enduring hope . 
+1 an absurdist comedy about alienation , separation and loss . 
+1 generally provides its target audience of youngsters enough stimulating eye and ear candy to make its moral medicine go down . 
-1 this limp gender-bender-baller from a first-time director and rookie screenwriter steals wholesale from that 1982's tootsie , forgetting only to retain a single laugh . 
+1 even if you've seen " stomp " ( the stage show ) , you still have to see this ! 
+1 rarely , indeed almost never , is such high-wattage brainpower coupled with pitch-perfect acting and an exquisite , unfakable sense of cinema . 
-1 the movie barely makes sense , with its unbelievable na√Øvet√© and arbitrary flashbacks . 
+1 becomes a fascinating study of isolation and frustration that successfully recreates both the physical setting and emotional tensions of the papin sisters . 
+1 claire is a terrific role for someone like judd , who really ought to be playing villains . 
-1 the messages of compassion and mercy are clearly , squarely and specifically expounded via computer animated old testament tale of jonah and the whale . determined to be fun , and bouncy , with energetic musicals , the humor didn't quite engage this adult . 
+1 confessions may not be a straightforward bio , nor does it offer much in the way of barris' motivations , but the film is an oddly fascinating depiction of an architect of pop culture . 
-1 this is the sort of burly action flick where one coincidence pummels another , narrative necessity is a drunken roundhouse , and whatever passes for logic is a factor of the last plot device left standing . 
-1 'opening up' the play more has partly closed it down . 
-1 an ambitiously naturalistic , albeit half-baked , drama about an abused , inner-city autistic teen . 
-1 the question hanging over the time machine is not , as the main character suggests , 'what if ? ' but rather , 'how can you charge money for this ? '
-1  . . . instead go rent " shakes the clown " , a much funnier film with a similar theme and an equally great robin williams performance . 
-1 the band performances featured in drumline are red hot . . . [but] from a mere story point of view , the film's ice cold . 
+1 the story itself it mostly told through on-camera interviews with several survivors , whose riveting memories are rendered with such clarity that it's as if it all happened only yesterday . 
+1 a carefully structured scream of consciousness that is tortured and unsettling--but unquestionably alive . 
-1 crudup's screen presence is the one thing that holds interest in the midst of a mushy , existential exploration of why men leave their families . 
+1 try as you might to scrutinize the ethics of kaufman's approach , somehow it all comes together to create a very compelling , sensitive , intelligent and almost cohesive piece of film entertainment . 
+1 as a science fiction movie , " minority report " astounds . 
+1 i know i shouldn't have laughed , but hey , those farts got to my inner nine-year-old . 
-1 at three hours and with very little story or character development , there is plenty of room for editing , and a much shorter cut surely would have resulted in a smoother , more focused narrative without sacrificing any of the cultural intrigue . 
+1 an average coming-of-age tale elevated by the wholesome twist of a pesky mother interfering during her son's discovery of his homosexuality . 
+1 the performances are amiable and committed , and the comedy more often than not hits the bullseye . 
+1 a whole lot foul , freaky and funny . 
+1  . . . quite endearing . 
-1 an ambitious , guilt-suffused melodrama crippled by poor casting . 
-1 it is supremely unfunny and unentertaining to watch middle-age and older men drink to excess , piss on trees , b . s . one another and put on a show in drag . 
+1 unfolds as one of the most politically audacious films of recent decades from any country , but especially from france . 
-1 in the era of the sopranos , it feels painfully redundant and inauthentic . 
-1 like a medium-grade network sitcom--mostly inoffensive , fitfully amusing , but ultimately so weightless that a decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen . 
-1 human nature initially succeeds by allowing itself to go crazy , but ultimately fails by spinning out of control . 
+1 the overall fabric is hypnotic , and mr . mattei fosters moments of spontaneous intimacy . 
+1 oscar wilde's masterpiece , the importance of being earnest , may be the best play of the 19th century . it's so good that its relentless , polished wit can withstand not only inept school productions , but even oliver parker's movie adaptation . 
-1 the mantra behind the project seems to have been 'it's just a kids' flick . ' translation : 'we don't need to try very hard . '
+1 lan yu is a genuine love story , full of traditional layers of awakening and ripening and separation and recovery . 
+1 so vivid a portrait of a woman consumed by lust and love and crushed by betrayal that it conjures up the intoxicating fumes and emotional ghosts of a freshly painted rembrandt . 
-1 complex , sinuously plotted and , somehow , off-puttingly cold . 
-1 a soulless jumble of ineptly assembled cliches and pabulum that plays like a 95-minute commercial for nba properties . 
+1 a movie where story is almost an afterthought amidst a swirl of colors and inexplicable events . 
-1 barney's ideas about creation and identity don't really seem all that profound , at least by way of what can be gleaned from this three-hour endurance test built around an hour's worth of actual material . 
+1 a smart , steamy mix of road movie , coming-of-age story and political satire . 
+1 a classic fairy tale that perfectly captures the wonders and worries of childhood in a way that few movies have ever approached . 
-1 a road trip that will get you thinking , 'are we there yet ? '
-1  . . . ( like ) channel surfing between the discovery channel and a late-night made-for-cable action movie . 
+1 the film is reasonably entertaining , though it begins to drag two-thirds through , when the melodramatic aspects start to overtake the comedy . 
-1 all movie long , city by the sea swings from one approach to the other , but in the end , it stays in formula -- which is a waste of de niro , mcdormand and the other good actors in the cast . 
+1 though a touch too arthouse 101 in its poetic symbolism , heaven proves to be a good match of the sensibilities of two directors . 
-1 it's a decent glimpse into a time period , and an outcast , that is no longer accessible , but it doesn't necessarily shed more light on its subject than the popular predecessor . 
+1 unlike the nauseating fictions peddled by such 'have-yourself-a-happy-little-holocaust' movies as life is beautiful and jakob the liar , the grey zone is honest enough to deny the possibility of hope in auschwitz . 
+1 seldahl's barbara is a precise and moving portrait of someone whose world is turned upside down , first by passion and then by illness . 
-1 a loquacious and dreary piece of business . 
+1 first and foremost . . . the reason to go see " blue crush " is the phenomenal , water-born cinematography by david hennings . 
-1 the episodic film makes valid points about the depersonalization of modern life . but the characters tend to be cliches whose lives are never fully explored . 
+1 while the humor is recognizably plympton , he has actually bothered to construct a real story this time . 
-1 the niftiest trick perpetrated by the importance of being earnest is the alchemical transmogrification of wilde into austen--and a hollywood-ized austen at that . 
+1 barney has created a tour de force that is weird , wacky and wonderful . 
+1 a moving essay about the specter of death , especially suicide . 
-1 you might say tykwer has done all that heaven allows , if you wanted to make as anti-kieslowski a pun as possible . suffice to say its total promise is left slightly unfulfilled . 
+1 yes , mibii is rote work and predictable , but with a philosophical visual coming right at the end that extravagantly redeems it . 
+1 were it not for a sentimental resolution that explains way more about cal than does the movie or the character any good , freundlich's world traveler might have been one of the more daring and surprising american movies of the year . 
-1 make like the title and dodge this one . 
+1 makes one thing abundantly clear . american musical comedy as we know it wouldn't exist without the precedent of yiddish theater , whose jolly , fun-for-fun's-sake communal spirit goes to the essence of broadway . 
+1 lan yu is at times too restrained , yet there are moments it captures the erotics of intimacy in a way that makes most american love stories look downright unfree . 
-1 ¬Öits solemn pretension prevents us from sharing the awe in which it holds itself . 
-1 fancy a real downer ? [leigh] lays it on so thick this time that it feels like a suicide race . 
+1 boomers and their kids will have a barrie good time . 
+1 'stock up on silver bullets for director neil marshall's intense freight train of a film . '
-1 tv skit-com material fervently deposited on the big screen . 
-1 all the well-meaningness in the world can't erase the fact that the believer feels like a 12-step program for the jewish nazi . 
-1 the truth is that the truth about charlie gets increasingly tiresome . 
+1 ong's promising debut is a warm and well-told tale of one recent chinese immigrant's experiences in new york city . 
-1 human nature , in short , isn't nearly as funny as it thinks it is ; neither is it as smart . 
+1 kids will love its fantasy and adventure , and grownups should appreciate its whimsical humor . 
-1 sade achieves the near-impossible : it turns the marquis de sade into a dullard . 
-1 mr . soderbergh's direction and visual style struck me as unusually and unimpressively fussy and pretentious . 
+1 a modest masterpiece . 
+1 absorbing and disturbing -- perhaps more disturbing than originally intended -- but a little clarity would have gone a long way . 
+1 a life-size reenactment of those jack chick cartoon tracts that always ended with some hippie getting tossed into the lake of fire . 
-1 the gantzes' interviews tend to let the guys off the hook . 
-1 the holes in this film remain agape -- holes punched through by an inconsistent , meandering , and sometimes dry plot . 
+1 ' . . . despite lagging near the finish line , the movie runs a good race , one that will have you at the edge of your seat for long stretches . '
-1 a gushy episode of " m * a * s * h " only this time from an asian perspective . 
-1 at once half-baked and overheated . 
+1 gets under the skin of a man who has just lost his wife . 
+1 if you can stomach the rough content , it's worth checking out for the performances alone . 
+1 it's a visual delight and a decent popcorn adventure , as long as you don't try to look too deep into the story
+1 a glorious mess . 
+1 a pleasant ramble through the sort of idoosyncratic terrain that errol morris has often dealt with . . . it does possess a loose , lackadaisical charm . 
-1 has not so much been written as assembled , frankenstein-like , out of other , marginally better shoot-em-ups . 
+1 it's another retelling of alexandre dumas' classic . why ? who knows , but it works under the direction of kevin reynolds . 
+1 it's a bit disappointing that it only manages to be decent instead of dead brilliant . 
+1 a tour de force of modern cinema . 
-1 a 93-minute condensation of a 26-episode tv series , with all of the pitfalls of such you'd expect . 
-1 a clutchy , indulgent and pretentious travelogue and diatribe against . . . well , just stuff . watching scarlet diva , one is poised for titillation , raw insight or both . instead , we just get messy anger , a movie as personal therapy . 
+1 a delightful surprise because despite all the backstage drama , this is a movie that tells stories that work -- is charming , is moving , is funny and looks professional . 
+1 delia , greta , and paula rank as three of the most multilayered and sympathetic female characters of the year . as each of them searches for their place in the world , miller digs into their very minds to find an unblinking , flawed humanity . 
+1 this documentary is a dazzling , remarkably unpretentious reminder of what [evans] had , lost , and got back . 
+1 a fleet-footed and pleasingly upbeat family diversion . 
+1 the pleasures that it does afford may be enough to keep many moviegoers occupied amidst some of the more serious-minded concerns of other year-end movies . 
-1 how this one escaped the lifetime network i'll never know . 
+1 this is a film well worth seeing , talking and singing heads and all . 
-1 such a premise is ripe for all manner of lunacy , but kaufman and gondry rarely seem sure of where it should go . 
+1 the result is something quite fresh and delightful . 
+1 it certainly won't win any awards in the plot department but it sets out with no pretensions and delivers big time . 
+1 chilling but uncommercial look into the mind of jeffrey dahmer , serial killer . 
+1 theirs is a simple and heart-warming story , full of mirth that should charm all but the most cynical . 
-1 even in this less-than-magic kingdom , reese rules . 
-1 children , christian or otherwise , deserve to hear the full story of jonah's despair -- in all its agonizing , catch-22 glory -- even if they spend years trying to comprehend it . 
+1 you will emerge with a clearer view of how the gears of justice grind on and the death report comes to share airtime alongside the farm report . 
-1 take away the controversy , and it's not much more watchable than a mexican soap opera . 
+1 is this love or is it masochism ? binoche makes it interesting trying to find out . 
+1 there has always been something likable about the marquis de sade . 
+1 films about loss , grief and recovery are pretty valuable these days . seen in that light , moonlight mile should strike a nerve in many . 
+1 by candidly detailing the politics involved in the creation of an extraordinary piece of music , [jones] calls our attention to the inherent conflict between commerce and creativity . 
-1 the script is a dim-witted pairing of teen-speak and animal gibberish . 
-1 too clever by about nine-tenths . 
-1 so riddled with unanswered questions that it requires gargantuan leaps of faith just to watch it plod along . 
+1 confessions isn't always coherent , but it's sharply comic and surprisingly touching , so hold the gong . 
+1 inherently caustic and oddly whimsical , the film chimes in on the grieving process and strangely draws the audience into the unexplainable pain and eccentricities that are attached to the concept of loss . 
-1 impeccably filmed , sexually charged , but ultimately lacking in substance , not to mention dragged down by a leaden closing act . 
+1 bright seems alternately amused and disgusted with this material , and he can't help throwing in a few of his own touches . 
-1 one minute , you think you're watching a serious actioner ; the next , it's as though clips from the pink panther strikes again and/or sailor moon have been spliced in . 
+1 para hitler , o mundo era sua tela ; e o horror , seu pincel . e max retrata este fato com elegante abandono , numa triste constata√ß√£o da realidade hist√≥rica . 
+1 a breathtaking adventure for all ages , spirit tells its poignant and uplifting story in a stunning fusion of music and images . 
+1 refreshing . 
-1 short and sweet , but also more than anything else slight¬Ö tadpole pulls back from the consequences of its own actions and revelations . 
+1 horns and halos benefits from serendipity but also reminds us of our own responsibility to question what is told as the truth . 
+1 ray liotta and jason patric do some of their best work in their underwritten roles , but don't be fooled : nobody deserves any prizes here . 
-1 the drama discloses almost nothing . 
-1 hope keeps arising that the movie will live up to the apparent skills of its makers and the talents of its actors , but it doesn't . 
+1 it irritates and saddens me that martin lawrence's latest vehicle can explode obnoxiously into 2 , 500 screens while something of bubba ho-tep's clearly evident quality may end up languishing on a shelf somewhere . 
+1 the message of such reflections--intentional or not--is that while no art grows from a vacuum , many artists exist in one . 
+1 the tone errs on the shrill side , tempered by a soft southern gentility that speaks of beauty , grace and a closet full of skeletons . 
-1 a movie to forget
+1 its director's most substantial feature for some time . 
+1 trademark american triteness and simplicity are tossed out the window with the intelligent french drama that deftly explores the difficult relationship between a father and son . 
-1 an uneven mix of dark satire and childhood awakening . 
+1 a fantastic premise anchors this movie , but what it needs is either a more rigid , blair witch-style commitment to its mockumentary format , or a more straightforward , dramatic treatment , with all the grandiosity that that implies . 
-1 a feature-length , r-rated , road-trip version of mama's family . 
-1 the film is a travesty of the genre and even as spoof takes itself too seriously . 
-1 maudlin and melodramatic we expected . boring we didn't . 
+1 [t]his beguiling belgian fable , very much its own droll and delicate little film , has some touching things to say about what is important in life and why . 
-1 with rare birds , as with the shipping news before it , an attempt is made to transplant a hollywood star into newfoundland's wild soil -- and the rock once again resists the intrusion . 
-1 equlibrium could pass for a thirteen-year-old's book report on the totalitarian themes of 1984 and farenheit 451 . 
-1 to me , it sounds like a cruel deception carried out by men of marginal intelligence , with reactionary ideas about women and a total lack of empathy . 
-1 though excessively tiresome , the uncertainty principle , as verbally pretentious as the title may be , has its handful of redeeming features , as long as you discount its ability to bore . 
+1 [broomfield] uncovers a story powerful enough to leave the screen sizzling with intrigue . 
-1  . . . although this idea is " new " the results are tired . 
-1 a rip-off twice removed , modeled after [seagal's] earlier copycat under siege , sometimes referred to as die hard on a boat . 
+1 it finds its moviegoing pleasures in the tiny events that could make a person who has lived her life half-asleep suddenly wake up and take notice . 
+1 some movies are like a tasty hors-d'oeuvre ; this one is a feast . 
-1 the problem with this film is that it's forced to make its characters idiots in order to advance the plot . had anyone here done anything remotely intelligent , we all could have stopped watching long ago . 
-1 a clumsily manufactured exploitation flick , a style-free exercise in manipulation and mayhem . 
-1 initially gripping , eventually cloying pow drama . 
-1 ms . phoenix is completely lacking in charm and charisma , and is unable to project either esther's initial anomie or her eventual awakening . 
+1 there are moments of hilarity to be had . 
+1 topics that could make a sailor blush - but lots of laughs . 
-1 what we have is a character faced with the possibility that her life is meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance , in a movie that is definitely meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance . 
+1 best indie of the year , so far . 
-1 the makers have forsaken the entertaining elements of the original and , instead , rehash old jokes and leave any life at the doorstep . i like frank the pug , though . 
-1 a respectable but uninspired thriller that's intelligent and considered in its details , but ultimately weak in its impact . 
-1 if this silly little cartoon can inspire a few kids not to grow up to be greedy bastards , more power to it . 
+1 quando tiros em columbine acerta o alvo ( com o perd√£o do trocadilho ) , n√£o h√° como negar o brilhantismo da argumenta√ß√£o de seu diretor . 
-1 ritchie's film is easier to swallow than wertmuller's polemical allegory , but it's self-defeatingly decorous . 
-1 in the end , all you can do is admire the ensemble players and wonder what the point of it is . 
-1 if this movie belonged to a sorority , it would be called beta alpha delta . 
+1 even in its most tedious scenes , russian ark is mesmerizing . 
+1 takes you by the face , strokes your cheeks and coos beseechingly at you : slow down , shake off your tensions and take this picture at its own breezy , distracted rhythms . 
-1 snoots will no doubt rally to its cause , trotting out threadbare standbys like 'masterpiece' and 'triumph' and all that malarkey , but rarely does an established filmmaker so ardently waste viewers' time with a gobbler like this . 
-1 why sit through a crummy , wannabe-hip crime comedy that refers incessantly to old movies , when you could just rent those movies instead , let alone seek out a respectable new one ? 
-1 as it abruptly crosscuts among the five friends , it fails to lend the characters' individual stories enough dramatic resonance to make us care about them . 
+1 is office work really as alienating as 'bartleby' so effectively makes it ? 
+1 a macabre and very stylized swedish fillm about a modern city where all the religious and civic virtues that hold society in place are in tatters . 
+1 mr . caine and mr . fraser are the whole show here , with their memorable and resourceful performances . 
-1 it's a film that hinges on its casting , and glover really doesn't fit the part . 
-1 [davis] wants to cause his audience an epiphany , yet he refuses to give us real situations and characters . 
+1 both grant and hoult carry the movie because they are believable as people -- flawed , assured of the wrong things , and scared to admit how much they may really need the company of others . 
-1 its story may be a thousand years old , but why did it have to seem like it took another thousand to tell it to us ? 
+1  . . . a well-observed and disturbing little movie
+1 how good this film might be , depends if you believe that the shocking conclusion is too much of a plunge or not . 
+1 smart and fun , but far more witty than it is wise . 
-1 the pace and the visuals are so hyped up that a curious sense of menace informs everything . 
-1  " freaky friday , " it's not . 
+1 films are made of little moments . changing lanes tries for more . it doesn't reach them , but the effort is gratefully received . 
-1 forced , familiar and thoroughly condescending . 
-1 the plot is plastered with one hollywood cliche after another , most of which involve precocious kids getting the better of obnoxious adults . 
-1 an improvement on the feeble examples of big-screen poke-mania that have preceded it . 
-1 for single digits kidlets stuart little 2 is still a no brainer . if you're looking to rekindle the magic of the first film , you'll need a stronger stomach than us . 
-1 needless to say , the dramatics that follow are utter hooey . 
-1 the story has its redundancies , and the young actors , not very experienced , are sometimes inexpressive . 
-1 by turns numbingly dull-witted and disquietingly creepy . 
+1 one of the year's best films , featuring an oscar-worthy performance by julianne moore . 
-1 despite the fact that this film wasn't as bad as i thought it was going to be , it's still not a good movie
-1 kids who are into this thornberry stuff will probably be in wedgie heaven . anyone else who may , for whatever reason , be thinking about going to see this movie is hereby given fair warning . 
-1 one lousy movie . 
+1 the movie's eventual success should be credited to dennis quaid , in fighting trim shape as an athlete as well as an actor
-1 guillen rarely gets beneath the surface of things . she lists ingredients , but never mixes and stirs . 
-1 has no reason to exist , other than to employ hollywood kids and people who owe favors to their famous parents . 
-1 to show these characters in the act and give them no feelings of remorse -- and to cut repeatedly to the flashback of the original rape -- is overkill to the highest degree . 
+1 insomnia does not become one of those rare remakes to eclipse the original , but it doesn't disgrace it , either . 
-1 perfectly enjoyable , instantly forgettable , nothing to write home about . 
-1 [carvey's] characters are both overplayed and exaggerated , but then again , subtlety has never been his trademark . 
-1 the whole damn thing is ripe for the jerry springer crowd . it's all pretty cynical and condescending , too . 
+1  . . . a gleefully grungy , hilariously wicked black comedy . . . 
+1 ana is a vivid , vibrant individual and the movie's focus upon her makes it successful and accessible . 
-1 exactly what you'd expect from a guy named kaos . 
-1 the locale . . . remains far more interesting than the story at hand . 
+1 desta vez , columbus capturou o pomo de ouro . 
+1 the entire cast is first-rate , especially sorvino . 
+1 savvy director robert j . siegel and his co-writers keep the story subtle and us in suspense . 
-1 an artful yet depressing film that makes a melodramatic mountain out of the molehill of a missing bike . 
+1 cool gadgets and creatures keep this fresh . not as good as the original , but what is . . . 
+1 a captivating new film . 
+1 boasts a handful of virtuosic set pieces and offers a fair amount of trashy , kinky fun . 
+1 stevens' vibrant creative instincts are the difference between this and countless other flicks about guys and dolls . 
-1 it will probably prove interesting to ram dass fans , but to others it may feel like a parody of the mellow , peace-and-love side of the '60s counterculture . 
+1 a pleasant piece of escapist entertainment . 
-1 illiterate , often inert sci-fi action thriller . 
+1  " what really happened ? " is a question for philosophers , not filmmakers ; all the filmmakers need to do is engage an audience . 
+1 director david jacobson gives dahmer a consideration that the murderer never game his victims . 
+1  . . . is there a deeper , more direct connection between these women , one that spans time and reveals meaning ? you bet there is and it's what makes this rather convoluted journey worth taking . 
+1 will grab your children by the imagination and amaze them and amuse them . 
+1 one of the smarter offerings the horror genre has produced in recent memory , even if it's far tamer than advertised . 
+1 it strikes hardest¬Ö when it reminds you how pertinent its dynamics remain . fifty years after the fact , the world's political situation seems little different , and [director phillip] noyce brings out the allegory with remarkable skill . 
-1 yet another movie which presumes that high school social groups are at war , let alone conscious of each other's existence . 
+1 a quietly moving look back at what it was to be iranian-american in 1979 . 
+1 mr . clooney , mr . kaufman and all their collaborators are entitled to take a deep bow for fashioning an engrossing entertainment out of an almost sure-fire prescription for a critical and commercial disaster . 
-1 whether this is art imitating life or life imitating art , it's an unhappy situation all around . 
+1 with this masterful , flawless film , [wang] emerges in the front ranks of china's now numerous , world-renowned filmmakers . 
-1 deserves high marks for political courage but barely gets by on its artistic merits . 
+1 two hours fly by -- opera's a pleasure when you don't have to endure intermissions -- and even a novice to the form comes away exhilarated . 
-1 an awkwardly contrived exercise in magic realism . 
-1 bigelow handles the nuclear crisis sequences evenly but milks drama when she should be building suspense , and drags out too many scenes toward the end that should move quickly . 
+1 a chilling movie without oppressive gore . 
+1 the film is bright and flashy in all the right ways . 
+1 hardly an objective documentary , but it's great cinematic polemic . . . love moore or loathe him , you've got to admire . . . the intensity with which he's willing to express his convictions . 
-1 the film is hampered by its predictable plot and paper-thin supporting characters . 
+1 tsai has managed to create an underplayed melodrama about family dynamics and dysfunction that harks back to the spare , unchecked heartache of yasujiro ozu . 
+1 a stirring road movie . 
-1 de ayala is required to supply too much of the energy in a film that is , overall , far too staid for its subject matter . 
+1 as quiet , patient and tenacious as mr . lopez himself , who approaches his difficult , endless work with remarkable serenity and discipline . 
-1 succumbs to the same kind of maudlin , sentimental mysticism that mars the touched by an angel school of non-god spiritual-uplift movies . 
-1 weaves a spell over you , with its disturbingly close-up look at damaged psyches and its subtle undercurrents of danger . but its awkward structure keeps breaking the spell . 
-1 stephen earnhart's documentary is a decomposition of healthy eccentric inspiration and ambition ¬ñ wearing a cloak of unsentimental , straightforward text ¬ñ when it's really an exercise in gross romanticization of the delusional personality type . 
-1 new yorkers always seem to find the oddest places to dwell . . . 
-1 instead of making his own style , director marcus adams just copies from various sources ¬ñ good sources , bad mixture
+1 some of the visual flourishes are a little too obvious , but restrained and subtle storytelling , and fine performances make this delicate coming-of-age tale a treat . 
+1 if you're down for a silly hack-and-slash flick , you can do no wrong with jason x . 
+1 the story's scope and pageantry are mesmerizing , and mr . day-lewis roars with leonine power . 
-1 nonsensical , dull " cyber-horror " flick is a grim , hollow exercise in flat scares and bad acting . 
+1 a very funny look at how another culture handles the process of courting and marriage . 
-1 high crimes miscasts nearly every leading character . 
+1 insomnia is one of the year's best films and pacino gives one of his most daring , and complicated , performances . 
+1 assured , glossy and shot through with brittle desperation . 
+1 a colorful , joyous celebration of life ; a tapestry woven of romance , dancing , singing , and unforgettable characters . 
+1 in the end , the film is less the cheap thriller you'd expect than it is a fairly revealing study of its two main characters ¬ó damaged-goods people whose orbits will inevitably and dangerously collide . 
+1 deflated ending aside , there's much to recommend the film . 
-1 they ought to be a whole lot scarier than they are in this tepid genre offering . 
+1 prancing his way through the tailor-made part of a male hooker approaching the end of his vitality , jagger obviously relishes every self-mocking moment . 
-1 a seriously bad film with seriously warped logic by writer-director kurt wimmer at the screenplay level . 
+1 fun , flip and terribly hip bit of cinematic entertainment . 
+1 smith examines the intimate , unguarded moments of folks who live in unusual homes -- which pop up in nearly every corner of the country . 
-1 every joke is repeated at least four times . every joke is repeated at least four times . every joke is repeated at least--annoying , isn't it ? 
+1 going to this movie is a little like chewing whale blubber - it's an acquired taste that takes time to enjoy , but it's worth it , even if it does take 3 hours to get through . 
+1 a compelling film . 
-1 doesn't get the job done , running off the limited chemistry created by ralph fiennes and jennifer lopez . 
-1 as pure over-the-top trash , any john waters movie has it beat by a country mile . 
+1 cool ? this movie is a snow emergency . 
-1 what more can be expected from a college comedy that's target audience hasn't graduated from junior high school ? 
+1 grenier is terrific , bringing an unforced , rapid-fire delivery to toback's heidegger- and nietzsche-referencing dialogue . 
+1 it's predictable , but it jumps through the expected hoops with style and even some depth . 
+1 one of the funniest motion pictures of the year , but . . . also one of the most curiously depressing . 
+1 there aren't many conclusive answers in the film , but there is an interesting story of pointed personalities , courage , tragedy and the little guys vs . the big guys . 
+1 visually imaginative , thematically instructive and thoroughly delightful , it takes us on a roller-coaster ride from innocence to experience without even a hint of that typical kiddie-flick sentimentality . 
+1 gives you the steady pulse of life in a beautiful city viewed through the eyes of a character who , in spite of tragic loss and increasing decrepitude , knows in his bones that he is one of the luckiest men alive . 
+1 intimate and panoramic . 
-1 gaping plot holes sink this 'sub'-standard thriller and drag audience enthusiasm to crush depth . 
-1 one problem with the movie , directed by joel schumacher , is that it jams too many prefabricated story elements into the running time . 
-1 this is the type of movie best enjoyed by frat boys and college kids while sucking on the bong and downing one alcoholic beverage after another . 
-1 many shallower movies these days seem too long , but this one is egregiously short . 
-1 can't kick about the assembled talent and the russos show genuine promise as comic filmmakers . still , this thing feels flimsy and ephemeral . 
-1 the filmmakers know how to please the eye , but it is not always the prettiest pictures that tell the best story . 
-1 the movie's vision of a white american zealously spreading a puritanical brand of christianity to south seas islanders is one only a true believer could relish . 
-1 uncertain in tone . . . a garbled exercise in sexual politics , a junior varsity short cuts by way of very bad things . 
-1 a simpler , leaner treatment would have been preferable ; after all , being about nothing is sometimes funnier than being about something . 
-1 for all its surface frenzy , high crimes should be charged with loitering -- so much on view , so little to offer . 
+1 witless but watchable . 
+1 it leaves little doubt that kidman has become one of our best actors . 
-1 in the end , the movie bogs down in insignificance , saying nothing about kennedy's assassination and revealing nothing about the pathology it pretends to investigate . 
-1 nicholas nickleby celebrates the human spirit with such unrelenting dickensian decency that it turned me ( horrors ! ) into scrooge . 
+1 consistently clever and suspenseful . 
-1 begins as a promising meditation on one of america's most durable obsessions but winds up as a slender cinematic stunt . 
-1 it's tough to tell which is in more abundant supply in this woefully hackneyed movie , directed by scott kalvert , about street gangs and turf wars in 1958 brooklyn -- stale cliches , gratuitous violence , or empty machismo . 
-1 rambles on in a disjointed , substandard fashion from one poorly executed action sequence to the next . 
+1 ya-yas everywhere will forgive the flaws and love the film . 
-1  . . . liotta is put in an impossible spot because his character's deceptions ultimately undo him and the believability of the entire scenario . too bad . 
+1 post 9/11 the philosophical message of " personal freedom first " might not be as palatable as intended . 
-1 it's always disappointing when a documentary fails to live up to -- or offer any new insight into -- its chosen topic . unfortunately , that's precisely what arthur dong's family fundamentals does . 
-1 the actors must indeed be good to recite some of this laughable dialogue with a straight face . 
+1 the very definition of the 'small' movie , but it is a good stepping stone for director sprecher . 
+1 it's all about anakin . . . and the lustrous polished visuals rich in color and creativity and , of course , special effect . 
-1 most of the problems with the film don't derive from the screenplay , but rather the mediocre performances by most of the actors involved
+1 the wonder of mostly martha is the performance of gedeck , who makes martha enormously endearing . 
+1 unlike most teen flicks , swimming takes its time to tell its story , casts mostly little-known performers in key roles , and introduces some intriguing ambiguity . 
+1 wow , so who knew charles dickens could be so light-hearted ? 
+1 flamboyant in some movies and artfully restrained in others , 65-year-old jack nicholson could be looking at his 12th oscar nomination by proving that he's now , more than ever , choosing his roles with the precision of the insurance actuary . 
+1 the fact is that the screen is most alive when it seems most likely that broomfield's interviewees , or even himself , will not be for much longer . 
-1 it's a very tasteful rock and roll movie . you could put it on a coffee table anywhere . 
+1 infidelity drama is nicely shot , well-edited and features a standout performance by diane lane . 
-1 sayles . . . once again strands his superb performers in the same old story . 
+1 [a]n utterly charming and hilarious film that reminded me of the best of the disney comedies from the 60s . 
-1 there's a delightfully quirky movie to be made from curling , but brooms isn't it . 
-1 harry potter and the chamber of secrets is deja vu all over again , and while that is a cliche , nothing could be more appropriate . it's likely that whatever you thought of the first production -- pro or con -- you'll likely think of this one . 
-1 an excruciating demonstration of the unsalvageability of a movie saddled with an amateurish screenplay . 
-1 i'm giving it thumbs down due to the endlessly repetitive scenes of embarrassment . there's got to be a more graceful way of portraying the devastation of this disease . 
-1 kaufman's script is never especially clever and often is rather pretentious . 
+1 it all plays out . . . like a high-end john hughes comedy , a kind of elder bueller's time out . 
-1 co-writer/director jonathan parker's attempts to fashion a brazil-like , hyper-real satire fall dreadfully short . 
-1 predictably soulless techno-tripe . 
-1 you can practically hear george orwell turning over . 
-1 too slow for a younger crowd , too shallow for an older one . 
+1 mel gibson fights the good fight in vietnam in director randall wallace's flag-waving war flick with a core of decency . 
+1 cletis is playful but highly studied and dependent for its success on a patient viewer . 
-1 the redeeming feature of chan's films has always been the action , but the stunts in the tuxedo seem tired and , what's worse , routine . 
-1 as the sulking , moody male hustler in the title role , [franco] has all of dean's mannerisms and self-indulgence , but none of his sweetness and vulnerability . 
+1 the film is darkly funny in its observation of just how much more grueling and time-consuming the illusion of work is than actual work . 
+1 es una de esas pel√≠culas de las que uno sale reconfortado , agradecido , genuinamente sorprendido . 
-1 given how heavy-handed and portent-heavy it is , this could be the worst thing soderbergh has ever done . 
+1 leave it to john sayles to take on developers , the chamber of commerce , tourism , historical pageants , and commercialism all in the same movie . . . without neglecting character development for even one minute . 
+1 it's solid and affecting and exactly as thought-provoking as it should be . 
-1 the lead actors share no chemistry or engaging charisma . we don't even like their characters . 
-1 a depressingly retrograde , 'post-feminist' romantic comedy that takes an astonishingly condescending attitude toward women . 
-1 less a heartfelt appeal for the handicapped than a nice belgian waffle . 
+1 below may not mark mr . twohy's emergence into the mainstream , but his promise remains undiminished . 
+1 this is such a dazzlingly self-assured directorial debut that it's hard to know what to praise first . 
+1 has the rare capability to soothe and break your heart with a single stroke . 
-1 consider the title's clunk-on-the-head that suggests the overtime someone put in to come up with an irritatingly unimaginative retread concept . 
-1 been there done that . 
+1  . . . the gentle melding of drama and comedy makes " what time is it there ? " something the true film buff will enjoy . 
+1 expect no major discoveries , nor any stylish sizzle , but the film sits with square conviction and touching good sense on the experience of its women . 
-1 despite the surface attractions -- conrad l . hall's cinematography will likely be nominated for an oscar next year -- there's something impressive and yet lacking about everything . 
+1 throws in enough clever and unexpected twists to make the formula feel fresh . 
-1  . . . tara reid plays a college journalist , but she looks like the six-time winner of the miss hawaiian tropic pageant , so i don't know what she's doing in here . . . 
-1 there are enough throwaway references to faith and rainbows to plant smile-button faces on that segment of the populace that made a walk to remember a niche hit . 
+1 ahhhh . . . revenge is sweet ! 
+1 13 conversations may be a bit too enigmatic and overly ambitious to be fully successful , but sprecher and her screenwriting partner and sister , karen sprecher , don't seem ever to run out of ideas . 
+1 a classy , sprightly spin on film . 
-1 it all looks and plays like a $40 million version of a game you're more likely to enjoy on a computer . 
+1 skillfully weaves both the elements of the plot and a powerfully evocative mood combining heated sexuality with a haunting sense of malaise . 
+1 a delectable and intriguing thriller filled with surprises , read my lips is an original . this is a story of two misfits who don't stand a chance alone , but together they are magnificent . 
+1 equilibrium is what george orwell might have imagined had today's mood-altering drug therapy been envisioned by chemists in 1949 . 
+1 while the ideas about techno-saturation are far from novel , they're presented with a wry dark humor . 
-1 woody allen can write and deliver a one liner as well as anybody . but i had a lot of problems with this movie . 
+1 director douglas mcgrath takes on nickleby with all the halfhearted zeal of an 8th grade boy delving into required reading . 
-1 feeble comedy . 
+1 [shyamalan] turns the goose-pimple genre on its empty head and fills it with spirit , purpose and emotionally bruised characters who add up to more than body count . 
-1 the drama was so uninspiring that even a story immersed in love , lust , and sin couldn't keep my attention . 
-1 this bond film goes off the beaten path , not necessarily for the better . 
+1 manages to transcend the sex , drugs and show-tunes plot into something far richer . 
-1 we may get the full visceral impact of a ruthless army on the warpath but no sense of the devilish complexity of the balkans conflict . 
-1 it's an 88-minute highlight reel that's 86 minutes too long . 
+1 in its treatment of the dehumanizing and ego-destroying process of unemployment , time out offers an exploration that is more accurate than anything i have seen in an american film . 
-1 it's a loathsome movie , it really is and it makes absolutely no sense . 
+1 stevens has a flair for dialogue comedy , the film operates nicely off the element of surprise , and the large cast is solid . 
+1 austin powers in goldmember is a cinematic car wreck , a catastrophic collision of tastelessness and gall that nevertheless will leave fans clamoring for another ride . 
-1 there's no point of view , no contemporary interpretation of joan's prefeminist plight , so we're left thinking the only reason to make the movie is because present standards allow for plenty of nudity . 
+1 an irresistible combination of a rousing good story set on a truly grand scale . 
+1  . . . spellbinding fun and deliciously exploitative . 
+1 the modern master of the chase sequence returns with a chase to end all chases
-1 trying to make head or tail of the story in the hip-hop indie snipes is enough to give you brain strain -- and the pay-off is negligible . 
-1 should have gone straight to video . it looks like an action movie , but it's so poorly made , on all levels , that it doesn't even qualify as a spoof of such . 
-1 an undistinguished attempt to make a classic theater piece cinematic . 
-1 originality is sorely lacking . 
-1 what can one say about a balding 50-year-old actor playing an innocent boy carved from a log ? 
-1 throwing in everything except someone pulling the pin from a grenade with his teeth , windtalkers seems to have ransacked every old world war ii movie for overly familiar material . 
-1 contrived , maudlin and cliche-ridden . . . if this sappy script was the best the contest received , those rejected must have been astronomically bad . 
-1 even a hardened voyeur would require the patience of job to get through this interminable , shapeless documentary about the swinging subculture . 
+1 a muddle splashed with bloody beauty as vivid as any scorsese has ever given us . 
-1 adam sandler's 8 crazy nights is 75 wasted minutes of sandler as the voice-over hero in columbia pictures' perverse idea of an animated holiday movie . 
+1 certainly the performances are worthwhile . 
-1 pretension , in its own way , is a form of bravery . for this reason and this reason only -- the power of its own steadfast , hoity-toity convictions -- chelsea walls deserves a medal . 
+1 schaeffer isn't in this film , which may be why it works as well as it does . 
+1 a grittily beautiful film that looks , sounds , and feels more like an extended , open-ended poem than a traditionally structured story . 
-1 a movie in which two not very absorbing characters are engaged in a romance you can't wait to see end . 
-1 two-bit potboiler . 
+1 an instance of an old dog not only learning but inventing a remarkable new trick . 
-1 after sitting through this sloppy , made-for-movie comedy special , it makes me wonder if lawrence hates criticism so much that he refuses to evaluate his own work . 
-1 a movie that , rather than skip along the seine , more or less slogs its way through soggy paris , tongue uncomfortably in cheek . 
+1 an exhilarating serving of movie fluff . 
-1 despite its dry wit and compassion , the film suffers from a philosophical emptiness and maddeningly sedate pacing . 
+1 a fine effort , an interesting topic , some intriguing characters and a sad ending . certainly the big finish wasn't something galinsky and hawley could have planned for . . . but part of being a good documentarian is being there when the rope snaps . 
-1 any movie this boring should be required to have ushers in the theater that hand you a cup of coffee every few minutes . like a marathon runner trying to finish a race , you need a constant influx of liquid just to get through it . 
-1 fans of so-bad-they're-good cinema may find some fun in this jumbled mess . 
+1 [fincher's] camera sense and assured pacing make it an above-average thriller . 
+1 halloween : resurrection isn't exactly quality cinema , but it isn't nearly as terrible as it cold have been . 
-1 such a bad movie that its luckiest viewers will be seated next to one of those ignorant pinheads who talk throughout the show . 
-1 the master of disguise may have made a great saturday night live sketch , but a great movie it is not . 
-1 too leisurely paced and visually drab for its own good , it succeeds in being only sporadically amusing . 
-1 it's just a little too self-satisfied . 
-1 pap invested in undergraduate doubling subtexts and ridiculous stabs at existentialism reminding of the discovery of the wizard of god in the fifth trek flick . 
-1 this goofy gangster yarn never really elevates itself from being yet another earnestly generic crime-busting comic vehicle -- a well-intentioned remake that shows some spunk and promise but fails to register as anything distinctive or daring
+1 in an era where big stars and high production values are standard procedure , narc strikes a defiantly retro chord , and outpaces its contemporaries with daring and verve . 
+1 maryam is a small film , but it offers large rewards . 
+1 too sincere to exploit its subjects and too honest to manipulate its audience . 
-1 if it were any more of a turkey , it would gobble in dolby digital stereo . if nothing else , " rollerball " 2002 may go down in cinema history as the only movie ever in which the rest of the cast was outshined by ll cool j . 
-1 flashy gadgets and whirling fight sequences may look cool , but they can't distract from the flawed support structure holding equilibrium up . 
+1 some may choose to interpret the film's end as hopeful or optimistic but i think payne is after something darker . 
+1 the artwork is spectacular and unlike most animaton from japan , the characters move with grace and panache . 
+1 this new zealand coming-of-age movie isn't really about anything . when it's this rich and luscious , who cares ? 
-1 audiences will find no mention of political prisoners or persecutions that might paint the castro regime in less than saintly tones . 
+1 tsai convincingly paints a specifically urban sense of disassociation here . 
-1 thekids will probably stay amused at the kaleidoscope of big , colorful characters . mom and dad can catch some quality naptime along the way . 
-1 diaz wears out her welcome in her most charmless performance
-1 it doesn't offer audiences any way of gripping what its point is , or even its attitude toward its subject . 
+1 whether seen on a 10-inch television screen or at your local multiplex , the edge-of-your-seat , educational antics of steve irwin are priceless entertainment . 
+1 gangster no . 1 is solid , satisfying fare for adults . 
+1 as allen's execution date closes in , the documentary gives an especially poignant portrait of her friendship with the never flagging legal investigator david presson . 
+1 a moody horror/thriller elevated by deft staging and the director's well-known narrative gamesmanship . 
+1 sturdy , entertaining period drama . . . both caine and fraser have their moments . 
+1 if there's no art here , it's still a good yarn -- which is nothing to sneeze at these days . 
+1 it provides the grand , intelligent entertainment of a superior cast playing smart people amid a compelling plot . 
+1 a captivating cross-cultural comedy of manners . 
-1 ultimately , the film amounts to being lectured to by tech-geeks , if you're up for that sort of thing . 
+1 heartwarming and gently comic even as the film breaks your heart . 
-1 a manipulative feminist empowerment tale thinly posing as a serious drama about spousal abuse . 
+1 a perverse little truffle , dainty psychological terror on the outside with a creamy filling of familial jealousy and unrepentant domestic psychopathy . 
-1 every time you look , sweet home alabama is taking another bummer of a wrong turn . 
+1 martin and barbara are complex characters -- sometimes tender , sometimes angry -- and the delicate performances by sven wollter and viveka seldahl make their hopes and frustrations vivid . 
-1 the phone rings and a voice tells you you've got seven days left to live . then you get another phone call warning you that if the video isn't back at blockbuster before midnight , you're going to face frightening late fees . o . k . , not really . 
+1 a marvelous performance by allison lohman as an identity-seeking foster child . 
+1 functions as both a revealing look at the collaborative process and a timely , tongue-in-cheek profile of the corporate circus that is the recording industry in the current climate of mergers and downsizing . 
+1 a violent initiation rite for the audience , as much as it is for angelique , the [opening] dance guarantees karmen's enthronement among the cinema's memorable women . 
+1 it's the unsettling images of a war-ravaged land that prove more potent and riveting than the unlikely story of sarah and harrison . 
+1 a pleasurably jacked-up piece of action moviemaking . 
-1 hey , at least the title of this film lets you know exactly where it's heading . 
+1 my oh my , is this an invigorating , electric movie . 
+1 an old-fashioned drama of substance about a teacher's slide down the slippery slope of dishonesty after an encounter with the rich and the powerful who have nothing but disdain for virtue . 
-1 ritchie may not have a novel thought in his head , but he knows how to pose madonna . 
+1 a serviceable euro-trash action extravaganza , with a decent sense of humor and plenty of things that go boom ¬ó handguns , bmws and seaside chateaus . 
-1 i'm not suggesting that you actually see it , unless you're the kind of person who has seen every wim wenders film of the '70s . 
+1 is truth stranger than fiction ? in [screenwriter] charlie kaufman's world , truth and fiction are equally strange , and his for the taking . 
+1 this is a nervy , risky film , and villeneuve has inspired croze to give herself over completely to the tormented persona of bibi . 
+1 'alice's adventure through the looking glass and into zombie-land' is filled with strange and wonderful creatures . 
-1 its simplicity puts an exclamation point on the fact that this isn't something to be taken seriously , but it also wrecks any chance of the movie rising above similar fare . 
-1 ze movie starts out so funny , then she is nothing . 
-1 there's not a comedic moment in this romantic comedy . 
+1 waydowntown is by no means a perfect film , but its boasts a huge charm factor and smacks of originality . 
+1 a touching , sophisticated film that almost seems like a documentary in the way it captures an italian immigrant family on the brink of major changes . 
-1 respons√°vel direto pelo fracasso 'art√≠stico' de doce lar , o roteirista c . jay cox n√£o consegue sequer aproveitar os pouqu√≠ssimos momentos em que escapa da mediocridade . 
+1 without [de niro] , city by the sea would slip under the waves . he drags it back , single-handed . 
-1 irwin is a man with enough charisma and audacity to carry a dozen films , but this particular result is ultimately held back from being something greater . 
+1 a grimly competent and stolid and earnest military courtroom drama . 
-1 animated drivel meant to enhance the self-image of drooling idiots . 
-1 this time kaufman's imagination has failed him . 
+1 often moving and explores the discomfort inherent in the contacts between the american 'hosts' and their 'guests . '
-1 crossroads feels like a teenybopper ed wood film , replete with the pubescent scandalous innuendo and the high-strung but flaccid drama . 
+1 nothing short of a masterpiece -- and a challenging one . 
-1 the story the movie tells is of brian de palma's addiction to the junk-calorie suspense tropes that have all but ruined his career . 
+1 the results , if not memorable , are at least interesting . 
-1 ' . . . the cast portrays their cartoon counterparts well . . . but quite frankly , scoob and shag don't eat enough during the film . '
-1 swimfan , like fatal attraction , eventually goes overboard with a loony melodramatic denouement in which a high school swimming pool substitutes for a bathtub . 
+1 the trials of henry kissinger is a remarkable piece of filmmaking ¬Ö because you get it . 
-1 the story really has no place to go since simone is not real¬óshe can't provide any conflict . 
+1 if we sometimes need comforting fantasies about mental illness , we also need movies like tim mccann's revolution no . 9 . 
+1 the events of the film are just so weird that i honestly never knew what the hell was coming next . 
+1 wiseman is patient and uncompromising , letting his camera observe and record the lives of women torn apart by a legacy of abuse . 
+1 as a singular character study , it's perfect . it's also the year's sweetest movie . 
-1 apparently , romantic comedy with a fresh point of view just doesn't figure in the present hollywood program . 
+1 the early and middle passages are surprising in how much they engage and even touch us . this is not a classical dramatic animated feature , nor a hip , contemporary , in-jokey one . it's sort of in-between , and it works . 
-1 although the sequel has all the outward elements of the original , the first film's lovely flakiness is gone , replaced by the forced funniness found in the dullest kiddie flicks . 
+1 god bless crudup and his aversion to taking the easy hollywood road and cashing in on his movie-star gorgeousness . 
-1 though the opera itself takes place mostly indoors , jacquot seems unsure of how to evoke any sort of naturalism on the set .

+1 as the two leads , lathan and diggs are charming and have chemistry both as friends and lovers . 
-1 the mushy finale turns john q into a movie-of-the-week tearjerker . 
+1 if you are an actor who can relate to the search for inner peace by dramatically depicting the lives of others onstage , then esther's story is a compelling quest for truth . 
+1 as green-guts monster movies go , it's a beaut . 
-1 looks more like a travel-agency video targeted at people who like to ride bikes topless and roll in the mud than a worthwhile glimpse of independent-community guiding lights . 
-1 ong chooses to present ah na's life as a slight , weightless fairy tale , whose most unpleasant details seem to melt away in the face of the character's blank-faced optimism . 
+1 an ambitious movie that , like shiner's organizing of the big fight , pulls off enough of its effects to make up for the ones that don't come off . 
+1 despite an overwrought ending , the film works as well as it does because of the performances . 
+1 caviezel embodies the transformation of his character completely .

+1 michael gerbosi's script is economically packed with telling scenes . 
-1 as saccharine as it is disposable . 
+1 doesn't do more than expand a tv show to movie length . however , it's pleasant enough and its ecological , pro-wildlife sentiments are certainly welcome . 
-1 the ethos of the chelsea hotel may shape hawke's artistic aspirations , but he hasn't yet coordinated his own dv poetry with the beat he hears in his soul . 
-1 the film doesn't really care about the thousands of americans who die hideously , it cares about how ryan meets his future wife and makes his start at the cia . 
+1 best enjoyed as a work of fiction inspired by real-life events . those seeking a definitive account of eisenstein's life would do better elsewhere . 
+1 witty and often surprising , a dark little morality tale disguised as a romantic comedy . 
-1 benigni presents himself as the boy puppet pinocchio , complete with receding hairline , weathered countenance and american breckin meyer's ridiculously inappropriate valley boy voice . 
-1 for all the complications , it's all surprisingly predictable . 
-1 a frankenstein mishmash that careens from dark satire to cartoonish slapstick , bartleby performs neither one very well . 
-1 it's almost as if it's an elaborate dare more than a full-blooded film . 
+1 the art direction and costumes are gorgeous and finely detailed , and kurys' direction is clever and insightful . 
-1 director kevin bray excels in breaking glass and marking off the " miami vice " checklist of power boats , latin music and dog tracks . he doesn't , however , deliver nearly enough of the show's trademark style and flash . 
+1 it may scream low budget , but this charmer has a spirit that cannot be denied . 
+1 alan and his fellow survivors are idiosyncratic enough to lift the movie above its playwriting 101 premise . 
+1 a deliciously nonsensical comedy about a city coming apart at its seams . 
+1 for anyone unfamiliar with pentacostal practices in general and theatrical phenomenon of hell houses in particular , it's an eye-opener . 
+1 instead of a hyperbolic beat-charged urban western , it's an unpretentious , sociologically pointed slice of life . 
+1 exposing the ways we fool ourselves is one hour photo's real strength . 
-1 this is the kind of movie that gets a quick release before real contenders arrive in september . 
+1 like kissing jessica stein , amy's orgasm has a key strength in its willingness to explore its principal characters with honesty , insight and humor . 
-1 by the time the surprise ending is revealed , interest cannot be revived . 
-1 bang ! zoom ! it's actually pretty funny , but in all the wrong places . 
-1 not an objectionable or dull film ; it merely lacks everything except good intentions . 
+1 secretary is not a movie about fetishism . it is a movie about passion . 
+1 photographed with melancholy richness and eloquently performed yet also decidedly uncinematic . 
+1 the movie's captivating details are all in the performances , from foreman's barking-mad taylor to thewlis's smoothly sinister freddie and bettany/mcdowell's hard-eyed gangster . 
+1 a must-see for the david mamet enthusiast and for anyone who appreciates intelligent , stylish moviemaking . 
-1 at times , the suspense is palpable , but by the end there's a sense that the crux of the mystery hinges on a technicality that strains credulity and leaves the viewer haunted by the waste of potential . 
+1 a quiet treasure -- a film to be savored . 
-1 this movie seems to have been written using mad-libs . there can be no other explanation . hilariously inept and ridiculous . 
-1 not just unlikable . disturbing . disgusting . without any redeeming value whatsoever . 
+1 a smart and funny , albeit sometimes superficial , cautionary tale of a technology in search of an artist . 
-1 soderbergh seems capable only of delivering artfully lighted , earnest inquiries that lack the kind of genuine depth that would make them redeemable . 
-1 when cowering and begging at the feet a scruffy giannini , madonna gives her best performance since abel ferrara had her beaten to a pulp in his dangerous game . 
+1 pure cinematic intoxication , a wildly inventive mixture of comedy and melodrama , tastelessness and swooning elegance . 
-1  . . . the film falls back on the same old formula of teen sex , outrageous pranks and scenes designed to push the envelope of bad taste for laughs . 
+1 a sentimental but entirely irresistible portrait of three aging sisters . 
+1 it's refreshing to see a girl-power movie that doesn't feel it has to prove anything . 
+1 though the plot is predictable , the movie never feels formulaic , because the attention is on the nuances of the emotional development of the delicate characters . 
+1 achieves a sort of filmic epiphany that revels in the true potential of the medium . 
-1 gets bogged down by an overly sillified plot and stop-and-start pacing . 
-1 where last time jokes flowed out of cho's life story , which provided an engrossing dramatic through line , here the comedian hides behind obviously constructed routines . 
+1 troubling and powerful . 
+1 like the series , the movie is funny , smart , visually inventive , and most of all , alive . 
-1 formula 51 is so trite that even yu's high-energy action stylings can't break through the stupor . 
-1 boy oh boy , it's a howler . 
-1 amid the shock and curiosity factors , the film is just a corny examination of a young actress trying to find her way . 
+1 a sexy , surprising romance . . . idemoto and kim make a gorgeous pair . . . their scenes brim with sexual possibility and emotional danger . 
-1 simply doesn't have sufficient heft to justify its two-hour running time . 
-1 an impenetrable and insufferable ball of pseudo-philosophic twaddle . 
+1 an action/thriller of the finest kind , evoking memories of day of the jackal , the french connection , and heat . 
+1 writer/director walter hill is in his hypermasculine element here , once again able to inject some real vitality and even art into a pulpy concept that , in many other hands would be completely forgettable . 
-1 the writers , director wally wolodarsky , and all the actors should start their own coeducational fraternity : kappa rho alpha phi . 
-1 the movie is too amateurishly square to make the most of its own ironic implications . 
+1 half submarine flick , half ghost story , all in one criminally neglected film
-1  . . . lacks the punch and verve needed to make this genre soar .

-1 a bore that tends to hammer home every one of its points . 
+1 a portrait of an artist . 
+1 aside from being the funniest movie of the year , simone , andrew niccol's brilliant anti-hollywood satire , has a wickedly eccentric enchantment to it . 
+1 ryosuke has created a wry , winning , if languidly paced , meditation on the meaning and value of family . 
+1 the limited sets and small confined and dark spaces also are homages to a classic low-budget film noir movie . 
-1 horrible
+1 a bilingual charmer , just like the woman who inspired it
-1 clare peploe's airless movie adaptation could use a little american pie-like irreverence . 
-1  . . . grows decidedly flimsier with its many out-sized , out of character and logically porous action set pieces . 
-1 trailer trash cinema so uncool the only thing missing is the " gadzooks ! " 
+1  . . . wallace is smart to vary the pitch of his movie , balancing deafening battle scenes with quieter domestic scenes of women back home receiving war department telegrams . 
-1 you see robin williams and psycho killer , and you think , hmmmmm . you see the movie and you think , zzzzzzzzz . 
+1 in all , this is a watchable movie that's not quite the memorable experience it might have been . 
-1 unfortunately , heartbreak hospital wants to convey the same kind of haughtiness in its own sketchy material but this territory has already been explored previously with better aplomb and sardonic wit . 
+1 adaptation's success in engaging the audience in the travails of creating a screenplay is extraordinary . 
+1 steve irwin's method is ernest hemmingway at accelerated speed and volume .

-1 only for young children , if them . their parents would do well to cram earplugs in their ears and put pillowcases over their heads for 87 minutes .

-1 pryor lite , with half the demons , half the daring , much less talent , many fewer laughs . 
-1 the filmmakers lack the nerve . . . to fully exploit the script's potential for sick humor . 
+1 it's one heck of a character study -- not of hearst or davies but of the unique relationship between them . 
-1 'all in all , reign of fire will be a good ( successful ) rental . '
+1 it is nature against progress . in fessenden's horror trilogy , this theme has proved important to him and is especially so in the finale . 
-1 the film has a few cute ideas and several modest chuckles but it isn't exactly kiddie-friendly¬Ö alas , santa is more ho-hum than ho-ho-ho and the snowman ( who never gets to play that flute ) has all the charm of a meltdown . 
-1 falters when it takes itself too seriously and when it depends too heavily on its otherwise talented cast to clown in situations that aren't funny . 
+1 like all of egoyan's work , ararat is fiercely intelligent and uncommonly ambitious . 
-1 everything that was right about blade is wrong in its sequel . 
-1 richard pryor mined his personal horrors and came up with a treasure chest of material , but lawrence gives us mostly fool's gold . 
-1 one sloughs one's way through the mire of this alleged psychological thriller in search of purpose or even a plot .

+1 birthday girl is an amusing joy ride , with some surprisingly violent moments . 
-1 hip-hop prison thriller of stupefying absurdity . 
-1 your taste for jonah - a veggie tales movie may well depend on your threshold for pop manifestations of the holy spirit . 
+1 light years/ several warp speeds/ levels and levels of dilithium crystals better than the pitiful insurrection . which isn't to say that it's the equal of some of its predecessors . 
+1 i'd watch these two together again in a new york minute . 
+1 a wild comedy that could only spring from the demented mind of the writer of being john malkovich . 
-1 based on a david leavitt story , the film shares that writer's usual blend of observant cleverness , too-facile coincidence and slightly noxious preciousness . 
+1 unlike the speedy wham-bam effect of most hollywood offerings , character development -- and more importantly , character empathy -- is at the heart of italian for beginners . 
+1 worth a look as a curiosity . 
-1 the movie certainly has its share of clever moments and biting dialogue , but there's just not much lurking below its abstract surface . 
-1 dreary , highly annoying . . . 'some body' will appeal to no one . 
-1 there's plenty of style in guillermo del toro's sequel to the 1998 hit but why do we need 117 minutes to tell a tale that simply can't sustain more than 90 minutes . 
+1 deliberately and skillfully uses ambiguity to suggest possibilities which imbue the theme with added depth and resonance . 
+1 it sounds sick and twisted , but the miracle of shainberg's film is that it truly is romance

-1 unspools like a highbrow , low-key , 102-minute infomercial , blending entrepreneurial zeal with the testimony of satisfied customers . 
+1 poetic , heartbreaking . 
+1 a brain twister , less a movie-movie than a funny and weird meditation on hollywood , success , artistic integrity and intellectual bankruptcy . 
+1 foster nails the role , giving a tight , focused performance illuminated by shards of feeling . 
+1 the movie itself is far from disappointing , offering an original take on courtroom movies , a few nifty twists that are so crucial to the genre and another first-rate performance by top-billed star bruce willis . 
-1  . . . watching this film nearly provoked me to take my own life . and if the hours wins 'best picture' i just might . 
-1 you're too conscious of the effort it takes to be this spontaneous . 
+1 having had the good sense to cast actors who are , generally speaking , adored by the movie-going public , khouri then gets terrific performances from them all . 
-1 it's not a bad plot ; but , unfortunately , the movie is nowhere near as refined as all the classic dramas it borrows from . 
+1 watching this film , one is left with the inescapable conclusion that hitchens' obsession with kissinger is , at bottom , a sophisticated flower child's desire to purge the world of the tooth and claw of human power . 
+1 jagger the actor is someone you want to see again . 
+1 it sends you away a believer again and quite cheered at just that . 
-1 much-anticipated and ultimately lackluster movie . 
-1 not everything in the film works , including its somewhat convenient ending .

-1 characterisation has been sacrificed for the sake of spectacle . 
+1 using an endearing cast , writer/director dover kosashvili takes a slightly dark look at relationships , both sexual and kindred . 
-1 if you're a wwf fan , or you related to the people who watched the robots getting butchered in a . i . , you'll probably like rollerball . 
-1 the picture emerges as a surprisingly anemic disappointment . 
+1 plays out with a dogged and eventually winning squareness that would make it the darling of many a kids-and-family-oriented cable channel . 
-1 only two-fifths of a satisfying movie experience . 
-1 perceptive in its vision of nascent industrialized world politics as a new art form , but far too clunky , didactic and saddled with scenes that seem simply an ill fit for this movie . 
+1 without ever becoming didactic , director carlos carrera expertly weaves this novelistic story of entangled interrelationships and complex morality . 
+1 interesting both as a historical study and as a tragic love story . 
+1 you can almost see mendes and company getting together before a single frame had been shot and collectively vowing , 'this is going to be something really good . ' and it is . 
-1 the lack of naturalness makes everything seem self-consciously poetic and forced . . . it's a pity that [nelson's] achievement doesn't match his ambition . 
-1 deuces wild is an encyclopedia of cliches that shoplifts shamelessly from farewell-to-innocence movies like the wanderers and a bronx tale without cribbing any of their intelligence . 
-1 all mood and no movie . 
+1 the level of maturity displayed by this 33-year-old first-time feature director is astonishing , considering her inexperience and her subject matter . 
-1 i can't recommend it . but it's surprisingly harmless . 
-1 there is one surefire way to get a nomination for a best-foreign-film oscar : make a movie about whimsical folk who learn a nonchallenging , life-affirming lesson while walking around a foreign city with stunning architecture . 
+1 this may be dover kosashvili's feature directing debut , but it looks an awful lot like life -- gritty , awkward and ironic . 
+1 a work of extraordinary journalism , but it is also a work of deft and subtle poetry . 
+1 what makes this film special is serry's ability to take what is essentially a contained family conflict and put it into a much larger historical context . 
+1 it took 19 predecessors to get this ? 
+1 spielberg's first real masterpiece , it deserved all the hearts it won -- and wins still , 20 years later . 
-1 wildly incompetent but brilliantly named half past dead -- or for seagal pessimists : totally past his prime . 
-1 what goes on for the 110 minutes of " panic room " is a battle of witlessness between a not-so-bright mother and daughter and an even less capable trio of criminals . 
+1  with one exception , every blighter in this particular south london housing project digs into dysfunction like it's a big , comforting jar of marmite , to be slathered on crackers and served as a feast of bleakness . 
-1 it's tough to be startled when you're almost dozing . 
+1 the off-center humor is a constant , and the ensemble gives it a buoyant delivery . 
-1 this painfully unfunny farce traffics in tired stereotypes and encumbers itself with complications . . . that have no bearing on the story . 
+1 the cast is phenomenal , especially the women . 
+1 davis' candid , archly funny and deeply authentic take on intimate relationships comes to fruition in her sophomore effort .

+1 somewhat blurred , but kinnear's performance is razor sharp . 
-1 a standard haunted house tale transplanted to the high seas . 
-1 it made me want to wrench my eyes out of my head and toss them at the screen . 
-1 don michael paul uses quick-cuts , ( very ) large shadows and wide-angle shots taken from a distance to hide the liberal use of a body double ( for seagal ) . 
-1 in the telling of a story largely untold , bui chooses to produce something that is ultimately suspiciously familiar . 
+1 broomfield turns his distinctive 'blundering' style into something that could really help clear up the case . 
-1 every visual joke is milked , every set-up obvious and lengthy , every punchline predictable . there's no energy . 
-1 for those for whom the name woody allen was once a guarantee of something fresh , sometimes funny , and usually genuinely worthwhile , hollywood ending is a depressing experience
-1 all too familiar . . . basically the sort of cautionary tale that was old when 'angels with dirty faces' appeared in 1938 . 
-1 ice cube isn't quite out of ripe screwball ideas , but friday after next spreads them pretty thin . 
-1 everything that's worthwhile about collision course can already be seen on television . 
-1 a muddled limp biscuit of a movie , a vampire soap opera that doesn't make much sense even on its own terms . 
-1 the story and characters are nowhere near gripping enough . 
+1 a delightful entree in the tradition of food movies . 
+1 even those who would like to dismiss the film outright should find much to mull and debate . 
-1 accuracy and realism are terrific , but if your film becomes boring , and your dialogue isn't smart , then you need to use more poetic license . 
-1 it is most of the things costner movies are known for ; it's sanctimonious , self-righteous and so eager to earn our love that you want to slap it . 
+1 aniston has at last decisively broken with her friends image in an independent film of satiric fire and emotional turmoil . 
+1 the work of an artist tormented by his heritage , using his storytelling ability to honor the many faceless victims . 
-1 so putrid it is not worth the price of the match that should be used to burn every print of the film .

+1 grainy photography mars an otherwise delightful comedy of errors . 
+1 michael moore's latest documentary about america's thirst for violence is his best film yet . . . 
+1 nothing's at stake , just a twisty double-cross you can smell a mile away--still , the derivative nine queens is lots of fun .

-1 as it stands it's an opera movie for the buffs . 
+1 red dragon " never cuts corners . 
+1 schnitzler does a fine job contrasting the sleekness of the film's present with the playful paranoia of the film's past . 
-1 the mystery of enigma is how a rich historical subject , combined with so much first-rate talent . . . could have yielded such a flat , plodding picture . 
+1 these are lives worth watching , paths worth following . 
+1 short-story quaint , touchingly mending a child's pain for his dead mother via communication with an old woman straight out of eudora welty . 
+1 a film about a young man finding god that is accessible and touching to the marrow .

+1 happily stays close to the ground in a spare and simple manner and doesn't pummel us with phony imagery or music . 
-1 feels like a cold old man going through the motions . 
-1 an exceptionally dreary and overwrought bit of work , every bit as imperious as katzenberg's the prince of egypt from 1998 . 
-1 there's too much falseness to the second half , and what began as an intriguing look at youth fizzles into a dull , ridiculous attempt at heart-tugging . 
+1 like a skillful fisher , the director uses the last act to reel in the audience since its poignancy hooks us completely . 
+1 idiotic and ugly . 
+1 when the movie mixes the cornpone and the cosa nostra , it finds a nice rhythm . 
+1 parker holds true to wilde's own vision of a pure comedy with absolutely no meaning , and no desire to be anything but a polished , sophisticated entertainment that is in love with its own cleverness . 
+1 delivers the sexy razzle-dazzle that everyone , especially movie musical fans , has been hoping for . 
+1 you may be captivated , as i was , by its moods , and by its subtly transformed star , and still wonder why paul thomas anderson ever had the inclination to make the most sincere and artful movie in which adam sandler will probably ever appear . 
+1 a slick , well-oiled machine , exquisitely polished and upholstered .

-1 it isn't that stealing harvard is a horrible movie¬óif only it were that grand a failure ! it's just that it's so not-at-all-good . and i expect much more from a talent as outstanding as director bruce mcculloch . 
-1 the thing looks like a made-for-home-video quickie . 
-1 this 90-minute dud could pass for mike tyson's e ! true hollywood story . 
-1 the so-inept- it's-surreal dubbing ( featuring the voices of glenn close , regis philbin and breckin meyer ) brings back memories of cheesy old godzilla flicks . 
-1 like the chelsea's denizens . . . burdette's collage-form scenario tends to over-romanticize the spiritual desolation of the struggling artiste . 
+1  . . . understands that a generation defines its music as much as the music defines a generation . 
+1 maelstrom is a deliberately unsteady mixture of stylistic elements . 
-1 while holm is terrific as both men and hjejle quite appealing , the film fails to make the most out of the intriguing premise . 
+1 it's a fine , focused piece of work that reopens an interesting controversy and never succumbs to sensationalism . 
-1 the sweetest thing is expressly for idiots who don't care what kind of sewage they shovel into their mental gullets to simulate sustenance . 
+1 measured against practically any like-themed film other than its oscar-sweeping franchise predecessor the silence of the lambs , red dragon rates as an exceptional thriller . 
-1 walter hill's pulpy , stylized boxing melodrama undisputed nearly overcomes its questionable in-the-ring match-up with solid fight choreography and gritty prison authenticity . 
+1  " mostly martha " is a bright , light modern day family parable that wears its heart on its sleeve for all to see . 
+1 occasionally , in the course of reviewing art-house obscurities and slam-bam action flicks , a jaded critic smacks into something truly new . 
+1 a real audience-pleaser that will strike a chord with anyone who's ever waited in a doctor's office , emergency room , hospital bed or insurance company office . 
-1 if religious films aren't your bailiwick , stay away . otherwise , this could be a passable date film . 
+1 this is such a high-energy movie where the drumming and the marching are so excellent , who cares if the story's a little weak . 
-1 got some good , organic character work , lots of obvious political insights and little room for engaging , imaginative filmmaking in its nearly 2 1/2-hour , dissipated length . 
+1 most thrillers send audiences out talking about specific scary scenes or startling moments ; " frailty " leaves us with the terrifying message that the real horror may be waiting for us at home . 
-1 the unceasing sadism is so graphically excessive , the director just ends up exposing his own obsession . 
-1 a long-winded and stagy session of romantic contrivances that never really gels like the shrewd feminist fairy tale it could have been . 
+1 the cast . . . keeps this pretty watchable , and casting mick jagger as director of the escort service was inspired . 
-1 in the not-too-distant future , movies like ghost ship will be used as analgesic balm for overstimulated minds . right now , they're merely signposts marking the slow , lingering death of imagination . 
-1 the 70-year-old godard has become , to judge from in praise of love , the sort of bitter old crank who sits behind his light meter and harangues the supposed injustices of the artistic world-at-large without doing all that much to correct them . 
-1 the plot's clearly mythic structure may owe more to disney's strong sense of formula than to the original story . but while the highly predictable narrative falls short , treasure planet is truly gorgeous to behold . 
+1 you never know where changing lanes is going to take you but it's a heck of a ride . samuel l . jackson is one of the best actors there is . 
-1 the experience of going to a film festival is a rewarding one ; the experiencing of sampling one through this movie is not .

+1 the filmmakers wisely decided to let crocodile hunter steve irwin do what he does best , and fashion a story around him . 
+1 [sports] admirable energy , full-bodied characterizations and narrative urgency . 
+1 director nalin pan doesn't do much to weigh any arguments one way or the other . he simply presents his point of view that ayurveda works . no question .

+1 still rapturous after all these years , cinema paradiso stands as one of the great films about movie love . 
-1 what could have been a neat little story about believing in yourself is swamped by heavy-handed melodrama . 
-1 rarely has so much money delivered so little entertainment . 
+1 birot creates a drama with such a well-defined sense of place and age -- as in , 15 years old -- that the torments and angst become almost as operatic to us as they are to her characters . 
-1 the film takes the materials of human tragedy and dresses them in lovely costumes , southern california locations and star power . 
+1 it's a drawling , slobbering , lovable run-on sentence of a film , a southern gothic with the emotional arc of its raw blues soundtrack . 
+1 a summer entertainment adults can see without feeling embarrassed , but it could have been more . 
-1 so brisk is wang's pacing that none of the excellent cast are given air to breathe . 
+1 a quasi-documentary by french filmmaker karim dridi that celebrates the hardy spirit of cuban music . 
-1 corpus collosum -- while undeniably interesting -- wore out its welcome well before the end credits rolled about 45 minutes in . 
+1 compulsively watchable , no matter how degraded things get . 
+1 grant is certainly amusing , but the very hollowness of the character he plays keeps him at arms length
-1 the film's final hour , where nearly all the previous unseen material resides , is unconvincing soap opera that tornatore was right to cut .

+1 murderous maids may well be the most comprehensive of these films and also strike closest to the truth .

+1 poignant japanese epic about adolescent anomie and heartbreak . 
-1 the techno tux is good for a few laughs , as are chan and hewitt , but when such a good design turns out to be a cheap knockoff , we can't recommend anything but a rental for the tuxedo .

+1 the film is small in scope , yet perfectly formed . 
-1 this isn't just the cliffsnotes version of nicholas nickleby , it's the cliffsnotes with pages missing . 
-1 how i killed my father is one of those art house films that makes you feel like you're watching an iceberg melt -- only it never melts . 
+1 a fantastically vital movie that manages to invest real humor , sensuality , and sympathy into a story about two adolescent boys . 
+1 a whole lot of fun and funny in the middle , though somewhat less hard-hitting at the start and finish . 
+1 this is a harrowing movie about how parents know where all the buttons are , and how to push them .

-1 too loud , too long and too frantic by half , die another day suggests that the bond franchise has run into a creative wall that 007 cannot fly over , tunnel under or barrel through . 
+1 [a] smarter and much funnier version of the old police academy flicks . 
-1 [a] rather thinly-conceived movie . 
+1 e . t . works because its flabbergasting principals , 14-year-old robert macnaughton , 6-year-old drew barrymore and 10-year-old henry thomas , convince us of the existence of the wise , wizened visitor from a faraway planet . 
-1 the kind of spectacularly misconceived enterprise that only a sophisticated cinephile could have perpetrated . 
-1  . curiously , super troopers suffers because it doesn't have enough vices to merit its 103-minute length . 
-1 blue crush has all the trappings of an energetic , extreme-sports adventure , but ends up more of a creaky " pretty woman " retread , with the emphasis on self-empowering schmaltz and big-wave surfing that gives pic its title an afterthought . 
-1 it appears to have been made by people to whom the idea of narrative logic or cohesion is an entirely foreign concept . 
-1 feels at times like a giant commercial for universal studios , where much of the action takes place . 
+1 on its own cinematic terms , it successfully showcases the passions of both the director and novelist byatt . 
-1 while there's likely very little crossover appeal to those without much interest in the elizabethans ( as well as rank frustration from those in the know about rubbo's dumbed-down tactics ) , much ado about something is an amicable endeavor . 
-1 though its rather routine script is loaded with familiar situations , the movie has a cinematic fluidity and sense of intelligence that makes it work more than it probably should . 
+1 audrey tatou has a knack for picking roles that magnify her outrageous charm , and in this literate french comedy , she's as morning-glory exuberant as she was in am√©lie . 
+1 light , cute and forgettable . 
+1 the soundtrack alone is worth the price of admission . 
-1 a dreary rip-off of goodfellas that serves as a muddled and offensive cautionary tale for hispanic americans . 
+1 this is a film that manages to find greatness in the hue of its drastic iconography . 
+1 berling and b√©art . . . continue to impress , and isabelle huppert . . . again shows uncanny skill in getting under the skin of her characters . 
-1 a profoundly stupid affair , populating its hackneyed and meanspirited storyline with cardboard characters and performers who value cash above credibility . 
-1 the film is directed by wally wolodarsky from a script by joe jarvis and greg coolidge . these are names to remember , in order to avoid them in the future . 
-1 if you're really renting this you're not interested in discretion in your entertainment choices , you're interested in anne geddes , john grisham , and thomas kincaid . 
-1 too stupid to be satire , too obviously hateful to be classified otherwise , frank novak's irritating slice of lumpen life is as reliably soul-killing as its title is nearly meaningless . 
+1 may be spoofing an easy target -- those old '50's giant creature features -- but . . . it acknowledges and celebrates their cheesiness as the reason why people get a kick out of watching them today . 
+1 the film is hard to dismiss -- moody , thoughtful , and lit by flashes of mordant humor . 
-1 it's one long bore . 
+1 norton is magnetic as graham . 
-1 the biggest problem i have ( other than the very sluggish pace ) is we never really see her esther blossom as an actress , even though her talent is supposed to be growing . 
+1 it confirms fincher's status as a film maker who artfully bends technical know-how to the service of psychological insight . 
-1 has lost some of the dramatic conviction that underlies the best of comedies . . . 
+1 often messy and frustrating , but very pleasing at its best moments , it's very much like life itself . 
+1 brilliantly explores the conflict between following one's heart and following the demands of tradition . 
+1 nonchalantly freaky and uncommonly pleasurable , warm water may well be the year's best and most unpredictable comedy . 
-1 needs more impressionistic cinematography and exhilarating point-of-view shots and fewer slow-motion 'grandeur' shots and quick-cut edits that often detract from the athleticism . 
-1 the story itself is actually quite vapid . 
-1 there's more repetition than creativity throughout the movie . 
+1 digital-video documentary about stand-up comedians is a great glimpse into a very different world . 
+1 for all its problems . . . the lady and the duke surprisingly manages never to grow boring . . . which proves that rohmer still has a sense of his audience .

-1 rife with nutty cliches and far too much dialogue . 
+1 all leather pants & augmented boobs , hawn is hilarious as she tries to resuscitate the fun-loving libertine lost somewhere inside the conservative , handbag-clutching sarandon .

-1 [a] crushing disappointment .

+1 a chronicle not only of one man's quest to be president , but of how that man single-handedly turned a plane full of hard-bitten , cynical journalists into what was essentially , by campaign's end , an extended publicity department . 
+1 with we were soldiers , hollywood makes a valiant attempt to tell a story about the vietnam war before the pathology set in . 
-1 turns a potentially interesting idea into an excruciating film school experience that plays better only for the film's publicists or for people who take as many drugs as the film's characters
+1 not as well-written as sexy beast , not as gloriously flippant as lock , stock and two smoking barrels , but stylish and moody and exceptionally well-acted . 
+1 we get some truly unique character studies and a cross-section of americana that hollywood couldn't possibly fictionalize and be believed . 
+1 impresses you with its open-endedness and surprises . 
-1 un thriller manqu√© qui tombe sur les nerfs presque d√®s la premi√®re image . 
-1 exploitative and largely devoid of the depth or sophistication that would make watching such a graphic treatment of the crimes bearable . 
+1 the actors are simply too good , and the story too intriguing , for technical flaws to get in the way .

-1  " not really as bad as you might think ! " 
-1 if you recognize zeus ( the dog from snatch ) it will make you wish you were at home watching that movie instead of in the theater watching this one .

-1 may puzzle his most ardent fans . 
+1 the additional storyline is interesting and entertaining , but it doesn't have the same magical quality as the beginning of the story . i like the new footage and still love the old stuff . 
+1 if borstal boy isn't especially realistic , it is an engaging nostalgia piece . 
+1 many went to see the attraction for the sole reason that it was hot outside and there was air conditioning inside , and i don't think that a . c . will help this movie one bit . 
+1 one of the best films of the year with its exquisite acting , inventive screenplay , mesmerizing music , and many inimitable scenes of tenderness , loss , discontent , and yearning . 
+1 whether [binoche and magimel] are being charming or angst-ridden , they easily fill their scenes and , fine judges both , never overcook the hysteria . 
+1 it's a lovely film with lovely performances by buy and accorsi . 
+1 those moviegoers who would automatically bypass a hip-hop documentary should give " scratch " a second look .

+1 satisfyingly scarifying , fresh and old-fashioned at the same time . 
+1 a recent favourite at sundance , this white-trash satire will inspire the affection of even those unlucky people who never owned a cassette of def leppard's pyromania . 
-1 i'm not sure which will take longer to heal : the welt on johnny knoxville's stomach from a riot-control projectile or my own tortured psyche . 
-1 even horror fans will most likely not find what they're seeking with trouble every day ; the movie lacks both thrills and humor . 
-1 no matter how firmly director john stainton has his tongue in his cheek , the fact remains that a wacky concept does not a movie make . 
+1 the movie exists for its soccer action and its fine acting . 
+1 like its two predecessors , 1983's koyaanisqatsi and 1988's powaqqatsi , the cinematic collage naqoyqatsi could be the most navel-gazing film ever .

+1 griffiths proves she's that rare luminary who continually raises the standard of her profession . 
+1 antwone fisher certainly does the trick of making us care about its protagonist and celebrate his victories but , with few exceptions , it rarely stoops to cheap manipulation or corny conventions to do it . 
+1 for the most part , the film does hold up pretty well . 
+1 'a fresh-faced , big-hearted and frequently funny thrill ride for the kiddies , with enough eye candy and cheeky wit to keep parents away from the concession stand . '
+1 paid in full is remarkably engaging despite being noticeably derivative of goodfellas and at least a half dozen other trouble-in-the-ghetto flicks . 
-1 like a documentary version of fight club , shorn of social insight , intellectual pretension and cinematic interest . 
+1 funny but perilously slight . 
-1 occasionally funny , sometimes inspiring , often boring . 
+1 nicolas philibert observes life inside a one-room schoolhouse in northern france in his documentary to be and to have , easily one of the best films of the year . 
-1 while the performances are often engaging , this loose collection of largely improvised numbers would probably have worked better as a one-hour tv documentary . 
+1 it's a nicely detailed world of pawns , bishops and kings , of wagers in dingy backrooms or pristine forests . 
+1 symbolically , warm water under a red bridge is a celebration of feminine energy , a tribute to the power of women to heal . 
+1 exhilarating , funny and fun . 
+1 though the film is static , its writer-director's heart is in the right place , his plea for democracy and civic action laudable . 
+1 the terrific and bewilderingly underrated campbell scott gives a star performance that is nothing short of mesmerizing . 
-1 [allen's] been making piffle for a long while , and hollywood ending may be his way of saying that piffle is all that the airhead movie business deserves from him right now . 
+1 this riveting world war ii moral suspense story deals with the shadow side of american culture : racial prejudice in its ugly and diverse forms . 
+1 majidi's direction has never been smoother or more confident . 
+1 a riveting story well told . 
+1 the directing and story are disjointed , flaws that have to be laid squarely on taylor's doorstep . but the actors make this worth a peek . 
+1 davis is funny , charming and quirky in her feature film acting debut as amy . 
+1 the picture runs a mere 84 minutes , but it's no glance . it's a head-turner -- thoughtfully written , beautifully read and , finally , deeply humanizing . 
-1 the movie is virtually without context -- journalistic or historical . what's worse is that pelosi knows it . 
+1 all the pieces fall together without much surprise , but little moments give it a boost . 
-1 it kinda works and qualifies as cool at times , but is just too lame to work or be cool at others . 
-1 and if you appreciate the one-sided theme to lawrence's over-indulgent tirade , then knock yourself out and enjoy the big screen postcard that is a self-glorified martin lawrence lovefest . if you are willing to do this , then you so crazy ! 
+1 smarter than its commercials make it seem . 
-1 every so often a film comes along that is so insanely stupid , so awful in so many ways that watching it leaves you giddy . half past dead is just such an achievement . 
+1  . . . an otherwise intense , twist-and-turn thriller that certainly shouldn't hurt talented young gaghan's resume . 
+1 enormously enjoyable , high-adrenaline documentary . 
-1 as a director , eastwood is off his game -- there's no real sense of suspense , and none of the plot 'surprises' are really surprising . 
-1 the film favors the scientific over the spectacular ( visually speaking ) . 
-1 one long , numbing action sequence made up mostly of routine stuff yuen has given us before . 
-1 the waterlogged script plumbs uncharted depths of stupidity , incoherence and sub-sophomoric sexual banter . 
-1 the film virtually chokes on its own self-consciousness .

+1 maryam is more timely now than ever . 
+1 at times funny and at other times candidly revealing , it's an intriguing look at two performers who put themselves out there because they love what they do . 
+1 huston nails both the glad-handing and the choking sense of hollow despair . 
+1 it's incredible the number of stories the holocaust has generated . just when you think that every possible angle has been exhausted by documentarians , another new film emerges with yet another remarkable yet shockingly little-known perspective . 
+1 [lawrence bounces] all over the stage , dancing , running , sweating , mopping his face and generally displaying the wacky talent that brought him fame in the first place . 
-1 a portrait of alienation so perfect , it will certainly succeed in alienating most viewers . 
+1  " the best disney movie since the lion king " 
+1 fun and nimble . 
+1 the pianist is the film roman polanski may have been born to make . 
-1 not so much farcical as sour . 
+1  . . . with the gifted pearce on hand to keep things on semi-stable ground dramatically , this retooled machine is ultimately effective enough at achieving the modest , crowd-pleasing goals it sets for itself . 
+1 about schmidt is undoubtedly one of the finest films of the year . if you're not deeply touched by this movie , check your pulse . 
-1 payami tries to raise some serious issues about iran's electoral process , but the result is a film that's about as subtle as a party political broadcast . 
-1 any reasonably creative eighth-grader could have written a more credible script , though with the same number of continuity errors . 
-1 life or something like it has its share of high points , but it misses too many opportunities . 
+1 [director peter] jackson and his crew have so steeped themselves in the majesty of tolkien's writing that every frame produces new joys , whether you're a fan of the books or not . 
-1 there are just too many characters saying too many clever things and getting into too many pointless situations . where's the movie here ? 
+1 the performances are immaculate , with roussillon providing comic relief . 
-1 the only type of lives this glossy comedy-drama resembles are ones in formulaic mainstream movies . 
-1 the kids in the audience at the preview screening seemed bored , cheering the pratfalls but little else ; their parents , wise folks that they are , read books . 
-1 on the whole , the movie lacks wit , feeling and believability to compensate for its incessant coarseness and banality . 
+1 a slam-bang extravaganza that is all about a wild-and-woolly , wall-to-wall good time . 
-1 too ordinary to restore [harmon] to prominence , despite some creepy scenes that evoke childish night terrors , and a praiseworthy attempt to generate suspense rather than gross out the audience . 
-1 interminably bleak , to say nothing of boring . 
-1 a pint-sized 'goodfellas' designed to appeal to the younger set , it's not a very good movie in any objective sense , but it does mostly hold one's interest . 
+1 a heroic tale of persistence that is sure to win viewers' hearts . 
-1 despite the premise of a good story . . . it wastes all its star power on cliched or meaningless roles . 
+1 few films capture so perfectly the hopes and dreams of little boys on baseball fields as well as the grown men who sit in the stands . 
+1 an admirable , sometimes exceptional film
-1 well-meant but unoriginal . 
-1 at a brief 42 minutes , we need more x and less blab . 
-1 more dutiful than enchanting . . . terribly episodic and lacking the spark of imagination that might have made it an exhilarating treat . 
+1 shot largely in small rooms , the film has a gentle , unforced intimacy that never becomes claustrophobic . 
-1 spreads itself too thin , leaving these actors , as well as the members of the commune , short of profound characterizations
+1 [grant] goes beyond his usual fluttering and stammering and captures the soul of a man in pain who gradually comes to recognize it and deal with it . 
-1 it's definitely not made for kids or their parents , for that matter , and i think even fans of sandler's comic taste may find it uninteresting . 
+1 to the degree that ivans xtc . works , it's thanks to huston's revelatory performance . 
-1  . . . in the pile of useless actioners from mtv schmucks who don't know how to tell a story for more than four minutes . 
-1 there are touching moments in etoiles , but for the most part this is a dull , dour documentary on what ought to be a joyful or at least fascinating subject . 
-1 a beautifully shot but dull and ankle-deep 'epic . '
+1 a joyous occasion
-1 there might be some sort of credible gender-provoking philosophy submerged here , but who the hell cares ? 
+1 b√©art and berling are both superb , while huppert . . . is magnificent . 
+1 that jack nicholson makes this man so watchable is a tribute not only to his craft , but to his legend . 
-1 aptly named , this shimmering , beautifully costumed and filmed production doesn't work for me . 
+1 although melodramatic and predictable , this romantic comedy explores the friendship between five filipino-americans and their frantic efforts to find love . 
+1 provides a very moving and revelatory footnote to the holocaust . 
-1 unfortunately , the experience of actually watching the movie is less compelling than the circumstances of its making . 
+1 in his debut as a film director , denzel washington delivers a lean and engaging work . 
+1  " the dangerous lives of altar boys " has flaws , but it also has humor and heart and very talented young actors
-1 visually sumptuous but intellectually stultifying . 
-1 the movie is loaded with good intentions , but in his zeal to squeeze the action and our emotions into the all-too-familiar dramatic arc of the holocaust escape story , minac drains his movie of all individuality . 
+1 a strong and confident work which works so well for the first 89 minutes , but ends so horrendously confusing in the final two
+1 the casting of raymond j . barry as the 'assassin' greatly enhances the quality of neil burger's impressive fake documentary . 
-1 the best thing about the movie is its personable , amusing cast . 
+1 [a] real pleasure in its laid-back way . 
+1 a refreshingly honest and ultimately touching tale of the sort of people usually ignored in contemporary american film . search it out . 
+1 this ready-made midnight movie probably won't stand the cold light of day , but under the right conditions , it's goofy ( if not entirely wholesome ) fun . 
+1 like any good romance , son of the bride , proves it's never too late to learn .
